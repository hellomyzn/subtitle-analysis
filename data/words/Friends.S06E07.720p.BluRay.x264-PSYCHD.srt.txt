back
of
the
carpet
okay
well
here

a
rapport
going
with
a
woman
but
somehow
you
manage
to
kill
it
whats
your
secret
look
we
do
not
repel
women
okay
that
is
completely
untrue
oh
yes
we
do
my
man
remember
back
in
college
when
we
went
to
that
dance
and
you
walked
right
up
to
that
girl
you
liked
and
couldnt
stop
talking
about
the
irish
potato
famine
yeah
well
what
about
you
you
werent
so
hot
in
college
either
after
everything
he
said
hed
go
yeah
monica
doesnt
like
that
either
maybe
i
should
stop
doing
that
you
know
what
girls
dont
like
it
when
i
start
talking
about
science
thats
not
specific
to
girls
this
is
great
this
is
great
what
else
they
dont
like
you
correcting
their
grammar
and
they
dont
like
it
when
you
explain
why
your
jokes
are
funny
you
know
they
dont
like
it
when
you
keep
asking
them
if
they
like
you
man
i
am
so
lucky
i
have
monica
im
never
gonna
find
love
again
hey
phoebe
can
i
talk
to
you
for
a
second
sure
okay
um
i
phoebe
look
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
im
sorry
okay
i
handled
the
situation
horribly
and
i
should
not
have
lied
to
you
so
what
should
you
have
done
well
i
should
have
told
you
the
truth
uhhuh
which
is
well
you
know
the
reason
that
i
didnt
want
to
go
running
with
you
is
because
um
well
you
know
the
way
that
you
run
is
just
a
little
so
well
its
embarrassing
people
were
looking
at
us
like
we
were
crazy
why
do
you
care
because
theyre
people
but
people
that
you
dont
know
and
will
never
see
again
yes
but
still
they
are
people
with
eyes
well
i
didnt
get
embarrassed
running
next
to
miss
choo
choo
choo
choo
but
oh
okay
no
no
i
can
see
why
running
with
me
would
be
embarrassing
to
you
yeah
okay
youre
uptight
what
i
am
not
uptight
whoa
listen
i
am
not
uptight
man
thats
okay
rachel
im
not
judging
you
thats
just
who
you
are
me
im
more
free
you
know
i
run
like
i
did
when
i
was
a
kid
because
thats
the
only
way
its
fun
you
know
i
mean
didnt
you
ever
run
so
fast
you
thought
your
legs
would
fall
off
you
know
like
when
you
were
running
towards
the
swings
or
running
away
from
satan
the
neighbors
dog
okay
is
this
lamp
in
the
right
place
who
cares
i
repel
women
no
no
no
you
cant
come
in
here
ross
is
naked
what
what
i
couldnt
say
that
i
was
naked
because
shes
allowed
to
see
me
naked
why
does
anyone
have
to
be
naked
why
is
ross
naked
i
had
to
show
chandler
something
naked
yeah
i
uh
i
guess
i
have
a
uh
a
guy
problem
is
it
the
same
thing
that
chandler
had
look
just
come
back
later
well
get
everything
squared
away
and
you
can
come
back
later
okay
hey

still
some
of
chandlers
medicine
left
under
the
sink
in
the
bathroom
bye

must
focus
weve
got
to
get
everything
back
into
its
original
place
the
photo
album
there
were
millions

pictures
of
the
apartment
in
the
photo
album

im
just
you
know
i
just
dont
feel
that
way
about

because
i
was
trying
to
repel

for
me
to
come
in
now
uhhuh
why
is
everything

other
than
the
fact
that
the
room
got
so
much
brighter
when
you
came
into
it
well
the
end
table
is
wrong
the
couch
looks
bizarre
and
dont

me
started
on
the
refrigerator
magnets
okay
look
dont
be
mad
okay
but
after
i
unpacked
the
boxes
i
wanted
to
do
something
nice
for
you
so
i
cleaned
the
apartment
so
i
moved
everything
around
and
then
i
forgot
where
it
went
back
and

you
come
here
to
me
hold

ross
sit
anywhere
while
he
was
naked

it
said
that
by
the
year
there
will
be
computers
carrying
out
the
same
number
of
functions
as
an
actual
human
brain
so
theoretically
you
could
download
your
thoughts
and
your
memories
into
this
computer
and
live
forever
as
a
machine
uh
so
janine
do
you
know
what
were
doing
right
now
you
and
i
were
interfacing
