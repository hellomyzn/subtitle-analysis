its
so
weird
how
did
joey
end
up
kissing
charlie
last
night
i
thought
youd
end
up
kissing
charlie
i
thought
id
end
up
kissing
charlie
too
but
surprise
i
missed
most
of
the
party
charlies
a
girl
right
yeah
shes
this
new
professor
in
my
department
that
i
did
not
kiss
i
dont
know
why
joey
had
to
kiss
her
of
all
the
girls
at
the
party
god
why
do
you
care
so
much
yes
rachel
why
do
you
care
so
much
because
ross
is
the
father
of
my
child
you
know
and
i
want
him
to
hook
up
with
lots
of
women
all
im
saying
is
i
dont
think
that
joey
and
charlie
have
anything
in
common
i
dont
know
they
seemed
to
have
a
shared
interest
in
each
others
tonsils
wow
joey
and
a
professor
can
you
imagine
if
they
had
kids
and
if
the
kids
got
her
intelligence
and
joeys
raw
sexual
magnetism
those
nerds
would
get
laid
all
right
so
ross
youre
okay
with
all
this
i
mean
its
no
big
deal
i
just
met
her
im
fine
with
it
god
i
forgot
how
hot
she
was
im
gonna
get
some
more
coffee
hi
oh
you
know
ill
come
with
you
okay
so
a
professor
huh
yeah
she
is
cool
and
shes
so
smart
her
mind
is
totally
acrimonious
guess
thats
not
how
she
used
it
i
feel
like
i
owe
you
an
explanation
i
dont
ordinarily
go
around
kissing
guys
at
parties
im
well
im
kind
of
embarrassed
i
really
hope
you
dont
think
less
of
me
think
less
of
you
no
i
dont
think
less
of
you
i
mean
you
saw
someone
you
liked
and
you
kissed
them
those
people
who
like
someone
and
dont
kiss
them
those
people
are
stupid
i
hate
those
people
actually
im
a
little
surprised
at
myself
i
mean
joeys

different
from
the
guys
i
usually
date
theyre
all
professors
intellectuals
paleontologists
mostly
you
know
very
cerebral
yeah

out
of
business
she
wants
to
go
hunting
too
phoebe
come

i
dont
want
to
waste
it
it
would
be
like
throwing
away
bucks
okay
this
is
not
about
the
money
okay
its
about
corporate
greed
destroying
our
hearts
and
leaving
us
hollow
shells
i
dont
care
about
any
of
that
well
do
you
care
about
friendship
i
feel
really
strongly
about
this
please
dont
use
this
gift
certificate
im
asking
you
as
a
friend
oh
not
as
a
friend
phoebe
fine
i
wont
use
it
promise
i
promise
thank
you
well
i
am
going
hunting
hey
honey
i
missed
you
today
oh
yeah
yeah
hey
what
do
you
wanna
do
tonight
oh
well
maybe
we
could
uh
okay
trying
to
turn
me
on
by
making
a
mess
know
your
audience
besides
tomorrow
were
doing
those
fertility
tests
until
then
you
need
to
keep
your
tadpoles
in
the
tank
do
we
really
need
to
take
those
tests
weve
been
trying
to
have
a
baby
for
a
year
i
think
its
a
good
idea
to
find
out
if
everythings
okay
just
a
few
routine
tests
but
i
dont
want
to
do
it
in
a
cup
what
is
the
big
deal
its
weird
youre
in
a
doctors
office
its
not
okay
to
do
it
in
a
doctors
office
but
it
is
okay
to
do
it
in
a
parked
car
behind
a
taco
bell
i
cannot
believe
ross
told
you
that
and
in
my
defense
it
was
a
wendys
look
i
dont
want
to
do
these
tests
either
but
i
really
do
think
its
a
good
idea
im
sure
a
doctors
office
cant
be
worse
than
on
a
class
trip
to
the
hershey
factory
oh

damn
i

if
that
was

note
the
painterly
lines
and
subtle
impasto
on
this
canvas
monet
painted
quickly
and
usually
outdoors
as
his
elusive
subject
was
light
itself
now
do
you
have
any
idea
what
you
just
said
no
no
my
mouth
says

to
the
museum
monet
is
not
spelled
monay
i
just
i
wrote
that
out
phonetically
for
you
phonetically
yeah
that
means
we
just
dont
have
time
for
this
i
gotta
say
im
really
impressed
you
were
able
to
memorize
all
this
so
quickly
im
an
actor
i
can
memorize
anything
last
week
on
days
i
had
to
say
frontal
temporal
zygomatic
craniotomy
wow
what
does
that
mean
no
idea
but
the
guy
i
said
it
to
dies
in
the
next
scene
so
i
guess
it
means
youll
get
eaten
by
a
bear
okay
so
lets
move
on
to
the
renaissance
okay
caravaggio
uses
chiaroscuro
here
to
highlight
the
anguish
of
the
central
figure
touch

janice
youre

i
havent
even
thought
about
the
results
i
just
assumed
everything
would
be
okay
well
you
know
what
it
probably
is
but
what
if
its
not
okay
i
mean
what
if

a
reason
we
cant

meant
to
have
children
im
sure
its
gonna
be
just
fine
yeah
yeah
okay
thanks
i
cant
believe
i
didnt
even
think
of
that
i
guess
i
was
so
worried
about
having
to
come
here
and
do
that
you
can
do
it
in
a
taco
bell
parking
lot
but
you
cant
do
it
at
a
doctors
office
it
was
a
wendys
and
thats
the
swedish
national
anthem
thank
you
for
asking
wow
lkea
what
a
rich
culture
you
know
what
i
have
a
friend
whos
a
masseuse
oh
ja
ja
ja
shes
not
very
good
though
uhhuh
uhhuh
and
why
do
you
think
that
is
i
dont
know
maybe
its
because
shes
got
such
callousy
fingers
from
playing
crummy
guitar
or
maybe
she
has
trouble
loosening
your
knots
because
youre
such
a
highmaintenance
tightass
phoebe
you
know
its
me
well
for
like
a
half
an
hour
man
you
can
lie
about
sweden
how
can
you
come
here
why
didnt
you
tell
me
you
work
here
i
dont
have
to
tell
you
everything
you
do
if
youre
gonna
make
me
feel
guilty
for
getting
a
free
massage
tips
not
included
oh
why
did
you
lie
to
me
about
working
here
because
i
was
ashamed
okay
i
sold
out
for
the
cash
and
they
give
me
benefits
like
medical
and
dental
and
a
fourohwunk
but
you
know
you
pay
a
price
now
im
this
corporate
stooge
and
punching
a
clock
and
paying
taxes
phoebe
honey
if
you
hate
it
so
much
you
should
walk
out
there
right
now
and
quit
be
true
to
what
you
believe
in
honey
you
have
principles
and
i
so
admire
that
i
dont
have
any
you
know
what
youre
right
i
am
gonna
quit
its
time
i
took
my
life
back
good
for
you
pheebs
okay
if
you
guys
have
microphones
in
there
too
i
didnt
mean
any
of
that
i
love
you
aha
got
you
die
die
die
respectfully
professor
r
geller
hey
hi
hey
how
was
the
met
oh
the
museum
was
amazing
yeah
yeah
joey
really
knows
his
art
huh
not
so
much
no
he
had
clearly
memorized
all
this
stuff
to
say
and
some
of
it
didnt
even
make
any
sense
what
do
you
mean
well
for
one
he
was
talking
about
paintings
that
were
nowhere
around
wait
a
minute
when
you
guys
walked
into
the
met
did
you
go
to
the
right
no
no
we
went
to
the
left
oh
joey
joey
joey
still
it
seems
like
you
guys
are
having
a
great
time
together
yeah
yeah
its
fun
what
actually
joeys
your
friend
and
you
dont
know
me
that
well
itd
be
weird
well
i
mean
a
little
but
no
what
go
on
well
im
thinking
that
maybe
joey
isnt
the
right
guy
for
me
right
now
you
know
maybe
i
should
be
with
someone
i
have
more
in
common
with
you
know
what
i
mean
yeah
yeah
but
you
know
what
i
think
you
should
give
joey
a
chance
i
mean
hes
a
great
guy
and
sure
he
doesnt
know
that
much
about
art
but
you
can
always
talk
about
that
with
someone
else
i
guess
thats
true
if
you
think
about
it
he
memorized
all
that
stuff
because
he
thought
it
was
important
to
you
you
know
thats
the
kind
of
guy
joey
is
he
is
very
sweet
plus
he
is
hot
that
was
gonna
be
my
next
argument
hey
hey
you
ready
yeah
lets
go
wow
thanks
ross
yeah
hey
ross
that
art
stuff
worked
you
hooked
me
up
