you
doing
here
hey
you
know
what
you
are
in
our
apartment
all
the
time
this
is
just
a
drop
in
the
bucket
mister
it
doesnt
matter
the
important
thing
is
that
youre
here
youre
my
friend
and
youre
here
okay
just
a
little
scared
whats
going
on
the
most
amazing
thing
happened
tonight
i
thought
my
number
was
up
i
had
an
actual
neardeath
experience
what
happened
we
were
on
the
ridealong
with
gary
and
somebody
took
a
shot
at
me
really
no
a
car
backfired
but
i
thought
somebody
was
taking
a
shot
at
me
and
rach
i
survived
and
i
was
filled
with
this
great
respect
for
life
i
want
to
experience
every
moment
i
want
to
seize
every
opportunity
i
am
seeing
everything
so
clearly
now
because
a
car
backfired
okay
why
are
you
here
i
dont
know
how
this
fits
into
your
whole
seizing
thing
but
emily
called
you
today
you
talked
to
her
she
left
a
message
but
it
kind
of
got
erased
i
mean
theres
something
wrong
with
your
machine
what
did
she
say
something
about
having
second
thoughts
about
the
wedding
and
did
you
guys
make
a
mistake
breaking
up
and
she
wants
you
to
call
her
wow
that
was
a
good
thing
that
i
told
you
right
yeah
yes
of
course
okay
thank
you
thank
you
because
im
gonna
tell
monica
i
was
right
because
she
didnt
want
not
important
point
is
i
was
right
your
decision
okay
i
was
right
your
decision
right
i
guess
i
should
call
emily
no
thats
not
the
right
decision
thats
not
right
ross
come
on
i
mean
that
woman
made
you
miserable
okay
ross
do
you
really
want
to
get
back
into
that
okay
look
yesterday
i
wouldnt
have
even
considered
calling
her
back
but
my
exwife
calls
on
the
same
day
i
have
a
neardeath
experience
thats
gotta
mean
something
that
was
not
a
neardeath
experience
that
was
barely
an
experience
you
werent
there
maybe
this
is
something
that
im
supposed
to
seize
you
know
okay
you
know
what
maybe
this
is
not
about
seizing
stuff
maybe
this
is
about
escaping
stuff
okay
look
at
today
i
mean
you
escaped
death
and
maybe
this
is
a
chance
for
you
to
escape
getting
back
together
with
emily
that
does
make
sense
because
i
do
want
to
seize
some
opportunity
but
i
really
dont
want
to
see
or
talk
to
her
well
there
you
go
yeah
maybe
todays
just
closecall
day
hey
thanks
rach
oh
honey
no
problem
wait
wait
the
message
is
blinking
maybe
you
didnt
erase
it
hey
ross
its
you
thats
an
old
message
nobody
needs
to
hear
that
hey
um
was
monica
here
yeah
i
want
my
money
back
you
probably
need
that
for
stamps
right
hey
pheebs
has
gary
ever
been
shot
at
for
real
yes
once
a
little
he
kind
of
did
it
to
himself
its
not
really
a
good
story
i
wonder
how
id
react
under
fire
and
not
backfire
but
heavy
fire
like
if
i
was
in
a
war
man
i
would
be
great
in
a
war
i
think
id
make
a
fantastic
military
leader
i
mean
i
know
id
make
general
before
any
of
you
guys
before
or
after
you
were
shot
by
your
own
troops
i
know
joey
would
be
in
the
foxhole
protecting
all
of
us
if
the
foxhole
was
lined
with
sandwiches
yeah
hero
sandwiches
you
all
know
im
a
pacifist
so
im
not
interested
in
war
in
any
way
but
when
the
revolution
comes
ill
have
to
destroy
you
all
not
you
joey
