a
little
crazy
that
you
get
all
my
points
i
dont
think
the
contestants
are
supposed
to
speak
to
each
other
why
did
you
invite
my
mother
what
she
wants
to
move
in
with
me
and
ross
to
help
take
care
of
the
baby
for
how
long
eight
weeks
i
mean
i
love
my
mother
but
my
god
a
long
lunch
with
her
is
taxing
i
personally
would
be
honored
if
she
wanted
to
live
with
me
she
cant
hear
you
you
guys
come
on
what
am
i
gonna
do
if
you
dont
want
your
mother
to
move
in
with
you
just
tell
her
youre
right
youre
right
im
about
to
have
a
baby
i
can
tell
my
mother
that
i
dont
want
her
to
be
sleeping
on
my
couch
oh
my
god
shes
gonna
wanna
sleep
in
my
bed
with
me
this
cannot
happen
thats
right
that
is
right
you
go
over
there
and
tell
her
you
do
not
want
her
to
live
with
you
do
not
take
no
for
an
answer
okay

is
great
now
shes
gonna
be
mad
at
rachel

had
i
have
new
respect
for
chandler
all

i
think
that
the
first
gift
that

the
most
important
person
in
this
room
and
in
the
world

mrs

it
is
rude
to
leave
a
party
without
saying
goodbye
to
the
host
and
also
when
someone
apologizes
to
you
the
decent
thing
to
do
is
to
accept
it
because
what
i
did
to
you
it
wasnt
on
purpose
but
what
youre
doing
to
me
now
is
plain
spiteful
