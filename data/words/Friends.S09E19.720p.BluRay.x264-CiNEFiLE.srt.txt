ate
his

a
dream
last
night
that
i
wanted
to
kiss
joey
wow

mean
like
kiss
him
kiss
him
oh
yeah
i
mean
it
was
pretty
intense
what
brought
that
on
i
dont
know
maybe
it
had
to
do
with
the
fact
i
saw
him
do
a
love
scene
a
love
scene
with
who
olivia
olivia
i
thought
she
was
marrying
connor
oh
right
real
life
more
important
you
think
my
dream
means
anything
i
dont
know
i
mean
you
saw
him
do
a
love
scene
maybe
you
dont
have
a
thing
for
joey

a
thing
for
drake

my
diamonds
out
of
the
vault
phoebe
its
not
what

garlics

hi
im
monica
geller
im
the
head
chef
here
okay
i
was
actually
expecting
a
little
applause
there
but
whatever
quick
question
by
a
show
of
hands
how
many
of
you
were
bothered
by
this
womans
singing
outside
okay
okay
how
many
of
you
enjoyed
the
music
outside
ha
let
me
ask
you
this
question
how
many
thought
the
music
was
fine
but
not
in
keeping
with
the
tone
of
the
restaurant
who
identified
this
restaurants
tone
as
pretentiouscommagarlicky
okay
who
thinks
the
food
is
delicious
and
a
little
pretension
never
hurt
anyone
okay
well
all
right
who
thinks
the
food
is
fine
the
music
was
fine
but
your
evening
was
ruined
by
this
incessant
polltaking
excuse
us
all
right
heres
a
question
uh
who
was
so
worried
about
her
restaurant
being
fancy
that
she
made
a
big
deal
about
her
friend
playing
her
music
and
feels
really
bad
about
it
now
well
who
was
so
stupid
and
stubborn
that
she
lashed
out
against
her
friends
cooking
which
she
actually
thinks
is
pretty
great
im
sorry
im
sorry
too
hey
you
wanna
stick
around
and
ill
whip
you
up
some
dinner
yeah
as
long
as
its
free
the
food
here
is
ridiculously
overpr
who
hopes
the
handraising
thing
is
still
cute
enough
that
you
wont
hate
me
joey
do
you
have
peanut
butter
on
the
back
of
your
head

was
making
a
peanut
butter
smoothie
right
i
couldnt
find
this
little
plastic
thingy
that
goes
in
the
top
of
the
blender
and
i
thought
well

know
how
important
can
that
be
right

out
very
wow

hows
it
going
with
drake
