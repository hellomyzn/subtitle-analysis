expensive
what
is
the
point
of
having
them
if
we
never
use
them
okay
but
if
something
breaks
and
then
the
queen
comes
over
i
will
explain
it
to
her

some
help
here
right
okay
so
its
not
just
the
lie
you

its
the
way
you
tell
it
for
example
if
you
look
at
the
ground
when
you
talk
people
know
youre
lying
i
dont
know
why
this
is
so
hard
for
me
lying
is
basically
just
acting
and
i
am
a
terrific
actor
you
are
a
terrific
actor
hey
wheres
the
baby
we
just
put
her
down
for
a
nap
listen
i
was
just
thinking
you
know
what
would
be
incredible
if
you
guys
died
thank
you
amy
no
no
then
i
would
get
the
baby
it
would
be
just
like
a
movie
at
first
i
wouldnt
know
what
to
do
with
her
and
then
i
would
rise
to
the
occasion
then
id
get
a
makeover
and
get
married
thats
a
great
movie
yeah
listen
not
that
you
guys
could
stop
me
or
anything
because
you
know
youd
be
dead
but
i
was
thinking
about
changing
her
name
im
just
not
really
a
big
fan
of
emily
emma
emma
ross
wants
you
phoebe
why
does
she
keep
making
that
noise
honey
i
dont
know
how
to
tell
you
this
but
if
something
were
to
happen
to
ross
or
myself
you
wouldnt
get
the
baby
well
who
would
well
we
havent
officially
asked
them
yet
but
we
would
want
monica
and
chandler
i
cant
believe
youd
want
us
to
raise
emma
oh
my
god
im
so
moved
i
dont
believe
this
hold
on
a
second
you
guys
die
and
i
dont
get
your
baby
amy
see
were
a
lot
closer
to
monica
and
chandler
we
see
them
every
day
and
truthfully
you
dont
seem
connected
to
the
baby
connected
to
what
shes
a
lump
you
know
guys
ive
gotta
say
this
means
so
much
to
me
i
mean
that
you
would
trust
me
with
your
child
i
mean
we
all
know
that
monica
and
i
have
been
trying
to
have
a
baby
of
our
own
you
know
ive
had
my
doubts
about
my
skills
as
a
father
but
that
you
two
that
you
two
this
guy
seriously
okay
its
time
for
dinner
everyone
were
using
our
fancy
china
and
its
very
expensive
so
please
be
careful
whoa
whoa
whoa
okay
just
to
be
clear
comedy
with
the
plates
will
not
be
wellreceived
hey
how
come
my
plates
less
fancy
than
everyone
elses
do
you
not
trust
me
with
a
fancy
plate
no
honey
thats
a
special
plate
see
its
a
game
whoever
gets
that
plate
wins
i
cant
believe
i
won
you
know
this
is
such
a
slap
in
the
face
i
mean
im
your
sister
and
you
would
give
your
baby
to
these
strangers
over
me
monica
is
ross
sister
no
ross
sister
was
really
fat
that
was
me
no
she
was
this
dorky
girl
in
school
who
followed
rachel
around
like
a
puppy
amy
youve
got
to
stop
doing
that
okay
listen
i
know
youre
having
a
bit
of
a
family
crisis
but
you
dont
have
to
take
it
out
on
the
plates
i
mean
in
fact
i
think
that
everyone
should
cut
their
food
like
this
now
see
this
way
you
protect
the
plates
and
lets
face
it
you
have
fun
okay
how
about
this
if
you
guys
die
and
the
crazy
plate
lady
dies
then
do
i
get
the
baby
no
if
crazy
plate
lady
if
monica
dies
then
i
would
get
emma
right
well
actually
actually
what
its
just
its
just
that
in
that
case
then
emma
would
go
to
my
parents
what
hurts
doesnt
it
who
has
to
die
for
me
to
get
her
so
if
monicas
not
around
im
not
good
enough
to
raise
emma
no
that
is
not
what
were
saying
yeah
hes
lying
he
looked
down
well
whats
wrong
with
me
am
i
incompetent
because
i
managed
to
survive
whatever
it
is
that
killed
the
three
of
you
youre
taking
this
the
wrong
way
we
think
youll
be
a
wonderful
parent
its
just
youre
more
the
you
know
fun
parent
yeah
and
we
wanna
make
sure
emma
also
has
someone
like
monica
whos
more
of
a
disciplinarian
someone
who
can
be
firm
and
strict
thats
not
how
you
see
me
is
it
no
youre
all
about
the
fun
i
may
not
know
a
lot
about
babies
but
do
you
really
think
im
not
capable
no
you
both
are
equally
capable
its
just
youre
strongest
when
youre
together
okay
so
if
we
both
had
emma
and
i
died
shed
have
to
give
her
up
sure
monica
would
have
to
give
her
up
i
lie
better
than
that
right
let
me
just
get
this
straight
so
my
two
friends
die
i
get
emma
then
my
wife
dies
then
emma
the
one
tiny
ray
of
hope
left
in
my
life
gets
taken
away
from
me
theres
your
movie
hey
there
you
are
you
disappeared
after
dinner
did
somebody
miss
me
was
there
a
child
to
raise
poorly
ross
and
rachel
dont
know
what
theyre
saying
its
not
like
theyre
so
responsible
emma
is
a
product
of
a
bottle
of
merlot
and
a
fiveyearold
condom
no
but
theyre
right
im
not
a
strong
father
figure
and
i
never
will
be
no
you
learn
these
things
you
grow
into
it
yeah
but
its
not
who
i
am
everything
they
said
is
exactly
why
i
was
worried
about
having
a
kid
and
its
true
and
look
everybody
knows
it
i
dont
know
it
i
wanna
have
a
kid
with
you
because
i
think
youll
be
an
amazing
dad
at
the
fun
parts
and
at
the
hard
parts
well
can
you
picture
me
saying
go
to
your
room

that
to
me
last
week
how
hard

the
furniture
the
producer
from
days
left
a
message
asking
why
i
wasnt
at
the
parade
they
said
everybodys
really
pissed
off
at
me
and
they
all
got
to
meet
santa
its
okay
i
thought
of
the
perfect
lie
for
you
its
easy
to
remember
and
it
doesnt
invite
a
lot
of
questions
you
werent
at
the
parade

you
had
a
family
emergency
