a
combination
of
bernoullis
principle
and
newtons
third
law
of
motion
see
yeah
thats
the
same
as
it
has
something

a
few
things
for
the

oh
yeah
wow
i
had
totally
forgotten
about
him
thats
a
blast
from
the
past
huh
no
its
okay
honest
mistake
it
really
doesnt
mean
anything
i
mean
you
know
monica
refers
to
chandler
as
richard
all
the
time
she
does
lets
get
you
out
of
here
well
at
least
you
took
me
down
with
you
im
so
sorry
i
just
i
keep
thinking
about
mike
im
crazy
about
david
and
were
having
so
much
fun
together
why
why
do
i
miss
mike
thats
just
thats
gonna
go
away
right
well
i
guess
in
time
yeah
i
mean
my
feelings
for
richard
are
certainly
gone
you
just
did
it
again
chandler
your
feelings
for
chandler
are
certainly
gone
boy
phoebes
still
pretty
hung
up
on
that
mike
huh
i
wouldnt
read
too
much
into
it
still
a
girl
calls
you
by
her
exboyfriends
name
thats
not
a
good
thing
right
let
me
stop
you
there
because
i
think
i
see
where
this
is
going
im
not
very
good
at
giving
advice
see
if
you
want
advice
go
to
ross
or
monica
or
joey
for
advice
about
pizza
toppings
or
a
burning
sensation
when
you
pee
im
sorry
i
just
wish
there
was
something
i
could
do
you
know
well
you
know
phoebe
seriously
were
gonna
do
this
im
sorry
i
just
wish
i
could
make
her
forget
about
mike
already
why
did
phoebe
and
mike
break
up
oh
because
his
penis
was
too
big
im
sorry
thats
the
kind
of
thing
i
do
they
broke
up
because
mike
didnt
want
to
get
married
what
if
you
let
phoebe
know
youd
be
open
to
marriage
thats
great
thats
great
ill
propose
to
her
what
i
was
probably
going
to
do
it
at
some
point
no
i
didnt
mean
now
well
why
not
its
brilliant
goodbye
mike
well
see
you
at
the
wedding
fella
well
we
probably
wont
invite
you
to
the
wedding
but
well
thank
you
chandler
sincerely

welcome
glad
i
could
help
how
do

said
you
were
gonna
wear
a
thong
wheres
the
thong
ha
ha
i
didnt
mean
a
thong
i
meant
thongs
you
really
should
have
been
more
clear
about
that
youre
never
gonna
guess
who
i
just
saw
downstairs
oh
uh
uh
britney
spears
yeah
she
never
misses
these
conferences

say

i
thought
we

i
cant
i
have
seminars
all
day
i
promised
ross
id
look
at
his
speech
but
maybe
we

later
out
on
the
balcony
itll
be
romantic
will
you
wear
a
thong
i
will
if
you

a
very
weird
deal
im

i
got
tons
of
stuff
i

i
dont
know
whats
gonna
happen
with
phoebe
and
david
i
do
want
a
hint
huh
i
do
okay
im
sensing
this
is
some
kind
of
wordplay
because
you
are
pink
with
barely
controlled
glee
davids
gonna
propose
to
phoebe
what
why
because
we
were
talking
about
ways
he
could
beat
mike
and
i
told
him
phoebe
wanted
to
get
married
chandler
we
have
talked
about
this
you
are
not
supposed
to
give
people
advice
couldnt
you
have
made
some
inappropriate
joke
i
did
a
penis
one
just
so
i
know
what
was
so
wrong
about
what
i
said
theyve
only
been
going
out
for
a
few
weeks
phoebe
is
completely
hung
up
on
mike
i
mean
shell
say
no
davids
heart
will
be
broken
itll
be
too
hard
for
them
to
recover
and
then
phoebe
will
end
up
alone
again
man
thats
some
bad
advice
oh
hey
thank
god
you

you

very
hard
to
take
you
seriously
when
you
look
like
that
um
phoebe
um
i
have
uh
something
i
want
to
say
oh
god

lets

i
think
we
have
time
have
you

uh
phoebe
um
i
would
be
honored
if
uh
uh
spit
it
out
david
uh
phoebe
um
youre
an
amazing
woman
and
the
time
we
spent
apart
was
unbearable
of
course
the
sanitation
strikes
in
minsk
didnt
help
sure
okay
yeah
but
um
well
now
that
were
together
again
i
dont
ever
want
to
be
apart
so
to
that
end
oh
my
god
mike
its
david
actually
no
mikes
here
oh
hey
mike
hi
david
chandler
monic
oh
its
the
humidity
hi
phoebe
what
are
you
doing
here
i
have
a
question
i
need
to
ask
you
i
have
a
question
i
was
kind
of
gonna
ask
her
myself
yeah
i
understand
but
before
you
do
she
really
needs
to
hear
this
okay
would
you
care
for
my
seat
as
well
actually
yeah
thatd
be
great
well
thats
fair
youve
had
a
long
trip
phoebe
i
love
you
ive
missed
you
so
much
these
last
few
months
i
thought
we
were
apart
for
a
good
reason
but
i
realized
that
there
was
no
reason
good
enough
to
keep
me
from
spending
the
rest
of
my
life
with
you
kind
of
steps
on
the
toes
of
what
i
was
going
to
say
im
sorry
david
but
she
really
has
to
know
this
all
right
but
after
this
i
want
to
see
you
outside
if
the
rain
stops
youre
the
most
incredible
woman
ive
ever
met
how
could
i
lose
you
now
i
dont
actually
have
a
ring
i
have
a
ring
i
wouldnt
brag
about
that
big
guy
but
phoebe
will
you
marry
me
no
haha
i
love
you
but
i
never
needed
a
proposal
from
you
i
just
needed
to
know
we
were
headed
somewhere
that
we
had
a
future
we
can
have
any
future
you
want
okay
well
im
gonna
take
off
david
im
so
sorry
im
sorry
just
so
i
know
if
i
had
asked
first
yeah
i
might
have
said
yes
but
that
wouldve
been
wrong
please
you
dont
have
to
explain
i
mean
perhaps
if
i
hadnt
gone
to
minsk
things
would
have
worked
out
for
us
and
i
wouldnt
have
ruined
my
career
or
lost
that
toe
to
frostbite
it
was
a
good
trip
is
it
okay
if
i
hug
you
now
oh
yes
because
of
our
meddling
all
right
oh
isnt
this
nice
its
so
quiet
i
could
just
lie
here
all
day
oh
i
know
open
your
drapes
open
your
drapes
so
glad
we
got
adjoining
rooms
the
sun
is
out
hey
remember
when
i
had
corneas
go
to
the
pool
and
reserve
chairs
i
will
get
the
magazines
and
the
lotion
ladies
ross
speech
is
in
minutes
no
damn
it
walls
are
pretty
thin
guys
then
we
have
to
weigh
the
data
from
recent
mri
scans
and
dna
testing
which
call
into
question
information
gathered
from
years
of
carbon
dating
look
at
the
woman
sitting
out
by
the
pool
getting
tan
shes
all
leathery
and
wrinkled
im
so
jealous
finally
factor
in
the
profusion
of
new
species
recently
discovered
giganotosaurus
argentinosaurus
not
to
mention
coldsaurus
and
thats
just
the
herbivores
im
not
even
gonna
discuss
the
carnivores
their
heads
are
already
too
big
which
is
ironic
considering
their
stunted
cerebral
development
really
but
all
kidding
aside
in
much
the
same
way
that
homo
ergaster
is
thought
to
be
a
separate
species
from
homo
erectus
what
he
said
erectus
youre
kidding
right
no
he
really
said
it
and
while
there
are
certainly
vast
differences
between
these
mesozoic
fossils
and
the
example
of
homo
erectus
erectus
homo
right
in
a
very
real
way
we
can
bring
the
mesozoic
era
into
the
st
century
thank
you
really
great
thanks
guys
i
thought
it
was
wonderful
jarvis
oberblau
