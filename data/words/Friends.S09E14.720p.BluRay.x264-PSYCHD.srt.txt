ill
probably
be
back
around
but
shes
in
the
bedroom
all
ready
to
go
but
she
did
fall
back
to
sleep
so
shes
probably
exhausted
from
all
that
adorable
screaming
she
did
last
night
bye
bye
hey
i
hope
emma
isnt
making
it
too
hard
on
you
no
hey

been
great
yeah
yeah
i
want
you
to
know
that
with
rachel
staying
here
all
my
feelings
from
before
are
totally
over
and
even
if
they
werent
when
you
walk
in
on
a
woman
using
a
breast
pump
yeah
thatll
do
it
wow
so
how
are
you
im
okay
really
sure
i
mean
do
i
wish
me
and
rachel
living
together
would
have
worked
out
of
course
you
know
im
disappointed
but
its
not
like
its
a
divorce
well
actually
it
its
not
a
divorce
it
is
not
a
divorce
anyway
i
think
rachel
and
i
need
to
get
on
with
our
lives
maybe
start
seeing
other
people
wow
really
sure
why
not
in
fact
if
you
know
anyone
thatd
be
good
for
me
sure
i
know
lots
of
girls
yeah
any
names
come
to
mind
ooh
names
hey
hey
i
was
just
gonna
eat
want
something
what
you
got
okay
lets
see
we
got
strained
peas
strained
carrots
ooh
strained
plums
we
havent
tried
that
yet
goody
thanks
ha
ha
so
how
is
it
living
with
rachel
again
i
mean
apart
from
the
great
food
ha
ha
im
fine
im
fine
its
just
its
just
weird
whats
happening
with
her
and
ross
yesterday
he
asked
me
to
fix
him
up
with
somebody
rachel
asked
me
if
i
knew
anyone
for
her
too
why
are
they
doing
this
i
dont
know
theyre
so
perfect
for
each
other
its
crazy
you
know
whats
crazy
these
jars
what
is
there
like
two
bites
in
here
i
just
wish
theyd
realize
they
should
be
together
when
they
moved
in
together
i
figured
thats
where
things
were
headed
they
should
be
a
family
they
should
marry
and
have
more
children
yes
and
they
should
name
one
of
their
kids
joey
i
may
not
have
kids
someones
gotta
carry
on
the
family
name
you
know
what
maybe
once
they
start
dating
and
see
whats
out
there
theyll
realize
how
good
they
are
for
each
other
yeah
because
it
is
slim
pickings
i
had
this
date
last
night
yuck
mm
but
we
should
probably
keep
it
down
shes
still
in
the
bedroom
so
what
are
we
gonna
do
are
we
just
gonna
set
them
up
with
people
i
know
that
just
pushes
them
further
and
further
apart
i
know
what
we
can
do
we
could
set
ross
and
rachel
up
on
horrible
dates
so
theyll
realize
how
good
they
are
together
ooh
thats
a
great
plan
yeah
you
know
what
the
best
part
of
it
is
i
get
to
do
my
plan
laugh
okay
shh
shh
not
so
loud
we
dont
wanna
wake
up
uh

no
were
okay
im
still

because
as
of
this
afternoon
i

lets
do
this
i
dont

oh
come

i

a
minute
because
of
emma
oh
my

we
cant
do
this
we
cant

how
much
can
she
even
be
aware
of
at
this
age
well
shes
aware
when
we
leave
a
room
she
may
notice
if
we
start
canoodling
in
it
canoodling
well
i
cant
say
hump
or
screw
in
front
of
the
baby
i
dont
know
i
guess
having
sex
in
front
of
a
baby
isnt
so
horrifying
scarring
something
people
go
to
jail
for
i
guess
youre
right
you
guess
at
that
bedandbreakfast
we
didnt
have
sex
because
you
thought
a
deer
was
staring
through
the
window
well
what
kind
of
a
sick
bastard
wants
to
do
it
in
front
of
a
deer
wow

looks
so
good
i
think
im
gonna
have
the
chicken
i
just
have
to
say
this
youre
really
beautiful
oh
wow

very
sweet
thank

of
funnylooking
what

i
mean

not
what
