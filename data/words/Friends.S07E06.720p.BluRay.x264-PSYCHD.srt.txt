the
reason
i
asked
you
to
brunch
is
because

its
you
i
hope

so
much
youre
both
so
important
to

i
was
thinking
we

come
up
with
a
system
where
we
trade
off
being
maid
of
honor
hypothetically
if
phoebe

mine
yes

hypothetically
still
if

mine
rachel

be
phoebes
id
be
rachels
we
all
get
to
do
it
and
no
one
gets
upset
thats
a
pretty
good
idea
ill
do
that
so
whos
yours

thats
the
best
part
you

to
decide
why

to
