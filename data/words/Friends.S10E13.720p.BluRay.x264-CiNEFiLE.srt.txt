i

i
wanna
apologize
about
chandler
though
i
just
did
not
see
this
coming
new
york
is
awesome
what
is
with
you
ive
been
to
these
places
before
but
ive
never
really

them
yeah
you
miss
a
lot
when
youre

thanks
so
much
for
showing
me
around
oh
it
was
our
pleasure
were
so
much
enjoying
getting
to
know
you
well
if
theres
anything
else
you
wanna
know
oh
uh
okay
um
can
we
ask
you
some
questions
about
the
father
oh
sure
yeah
well
he
was
my
highschool
boyfriend
captain
of
the
football
team
really
cute
got
a
scholarship
and
went
to
college
thats
great
yeah
its
almost
definitely
him
hows
that
now
well
theres
a
chance
its
another
guy
i
mean
ive
only
ever
been
with
two
guys
but
they
sort
of
overlapped
so
what
does
the
other
guy
do
does
he
go
to
college
too
no
hes
in
prison
oh
well
um
was
he
falsely
accused
of
something
no
he
killed
his
father
with
a
shovel
other
than
that
hes
a
great
guy
ill
bet
his
dad
doesnt
think
so
are
you
awake
of
course
im
awake
assume
from
now
on
that
im
always
awake
all
right
we
dont
know
that
its
him
i
mean
it
could
be
the
football
guy
honey
its
us
of
course
its
the
shovel
killer
well
all
right
lets
say
that
it
is
him
would
we
not
want
the
baby
no
would
we
treat
him
any
differently
id
keep
an
eye
on
him
we
have
to
find
out
which
the
father
is
how
i
dont
know
they
have
tests
for
these
things
right
yeah
but
maybe
were
overreacting
easy
for
you
to
say
hes
a
father
killer
he
probably
loves
his
mommy
hes
probably
got
a
tattoo
that
says
mom
on
his
shovelwielding
arm
well
now
count
from
one
to
five
good
