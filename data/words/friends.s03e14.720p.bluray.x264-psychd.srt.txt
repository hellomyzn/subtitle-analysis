i
was

awful
horrible
thing
ive
ever

you

what
dont
tell

well
wait
till
chandler

okay
it
was
like
four
years

okay
ginger
and
i
had
gone
out
a
few
times
then
one
weekend
we
went
to
her
dads
cabin
just
me
her
and
her
annoying
little
dog
pepper
heh
well
that
night
i
cooked
this
really
romantic
dinner
you
gave
her
food
poisoning
i
wish
no
after
dinner
me
her
and
pepper
all
fell
asleep
in
front
of
the
fire
well
i
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
i
saw
that
the
fire
was
dying
out
so
i
picked
up
a
log
and
threw
it
on
or
at
least
what
i
thought
was
a
log
oh
my
god
you
threw
pepper
on
the
fire
i
wish
see

that
she
kind
of
has
a
uh
artificial
leg
