wow
i
cant
believe
we
have
to
say
goodbye
to
the
house
we
grew
up
in
man
some
strangers
gonna
be
living
in
my
room
well
after
years
of
mom
and
dad
keeping
it
as
a
shrine
to
you
its
time
the
velvet
ropes
came
down
they
kept
your
room
a
while
oh
please
dad
turned
my
room
into
a
gym
minutes
after
i
moved
out
and
i
gotta
say
a
tanning
bed
and
a
stack
of
victorias
secret
catalogs
not
a
gym
come
on
you
know
they
love
you
as
much
as
they
love
you
i
was
their
firstborn
they
thought
she
was
barren
its
not
my
fault
ugh
i
hate
this
year
whats
wrong
with
this
year
its
already
february
and
ive
only
given
two
massages
and
they
were
both
the
worst
tippers
in
the
world
that
was
me
and
ross
oh
thats
right
if
you
want
to
pick
up
some
extra
cash
some
friends
of
mine
made
good
money
in
college
doing
telemarketing
yeah
itd
probably
be
better
than
the
last
telephone
job
i
had
you
know
i
probably
wont
have
to
say
spank
as
much
what
oh
yeah
like
you
never
called
so
basically
this
is
very
easy
you
read
from
the
script
and
try
to
sell
as
much
toner
as
you
possibly
can
okay
i
can
do
that
oh
by
the
way
i
love
my
office
ha
ha
why
dont
we
do
a
trial
run
oh
okay
um
all
right
hi
this
is
phoebe
from
empire

but
you
were
kind
of
rude
theyre
always
gonna
tell
you
they
dont
need
toner
but
thats
okay
because
whatever
they
say
you
can
find
the
answer
to
it
here
in
the
script
oh
so
i
think
youre
ready
to
sell
toner
do
you
have
any

its
time
for

the
crack

yeah
now
why
do
you
want
to
kill
yourself
ive
been
working
for
years
now
at
this
meaningless
deadend
job
and
nobody
here
even
knows
that
i
exist
chandler
im
sorry
oh
look
im
sure
that
people
know
you
exist
oh
yeah
i
work
in
a
cubicle
surrounded
by
people
ive
been
talking
to
you
for
five
minutes
now
about
killing
myself
and
no
ones
even
looked
up
from
their
desk
hang
on
hey
everybody
uh
im
gonna
kill
myself
i
got
nothing
good
chair
now
if
anybody
asks
your
name
is
rosita
poor
thing
cut
down
in
her
prime
joey
the
new

hour
maybe
we
should
actually
move
rosita
out
of
here
you
know
start
the
healing
process
yeah
i
guess
youre
right
okay
shes
healed
thats
weird
no
its
not
weird
its
a
miracle
its
not
a
miracle
joey
im
sure
theres
an
explanation
there
is
if
you
want
something
enough
and
your
heart
is
pure
wondrous
things
can
happen
well
shell
understand
right
its
not
like
i
did
it
on
purpose

that
wont
matter
to
her
look
all
my
stuff
is
safe
and
dry
and
all
her
stuff
is
growing
new
stuff
see
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
makes
her
think
you
guys
love
me
more
than
you
love
her
oh
my
god
does
she
really
think
that
well
can
you
blame
her
i
dont
know
i
suppose
we
may
have
favored
you
unconsciously
you
were
a
medical
marvel
the
doctors
said
your
mom
couldnt
i
dont
want
to
hear
about
it
really
well
not
right
now
okay
look
monica
came
here
for
some
memories
damn
it
were
gonna
give
her
some
okay
grab
grab
some
empty
boxes
okay
well
take
stuff
from
mine
and
whatever
we
can
pass
off
as
hers
well
put
them
in
there
right
like
this
she
could
have
made
this
this
could
have
been
hers
sure
you
know
if
you
want
to
tell
the
medical
marvel
story
while
we
work
thatd
be
fine
i
am
so
psyched
