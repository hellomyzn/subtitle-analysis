mm
were
not
gonna
have
sex
okay
nothings
changed
here
he
still
doesnt

friends
naked
friends

any
ice
hey
check
the
freezer
if
theres
none
in
there
were
probably
out
are
you
just
getting
home
from
work
its
late
yeah
i
know
i
had
the
greatest
day
though
i
got
to
sit
in
on
a
meeting
with
the
reps
from
calvin
klein
i
told
my
boss
i
liked
this
line
of
lingerie
she
ordered
a
ton
of
it
how
was
your
day
i
discovered
im
able
to
count
all
my
teeth
using
just
my
tongue
hmm
um
why
do
you
have
a
copy
of
the
shining
in
your
freezer
oh
i
was
reading
it
last
night
and
i
got
scared
so
but
uh
youre
safe
from
it
if
its
in
the
freezer
well
safer
i
never
start
reading
the
shining
without
making
sure
we
got
plenty
of
room
in
the
freezer
you
know
ha
ha
how
often
do
you
read
it
havent
you
ever
read
the
same
book
over
and
over
again
well
um
i
guess
i
read
little
women
more
than
once
but
thats
a
classic
whats
so
great
about
the
shining
the
question
should
be
rach
what
is
not
so
great
about
the
shining
okay
and
the
answer
would
be
nothing
all
right
this
is
like
the
scariest
book
ever
i
bet
its
way
better
than
that
classic
of
yours
ha
ha

about
that
okay
i
will
