thats
the
thing
i
would
like
to
stay
in
the
prime
of

hey
hey
whats
up
um
i
think
theres
something
you
should
maybe
know
it
better
not
be
about
the
apartment
pants
because
i
just
pitched
the
idea
to
my
boss
at
ralph
lauren
and
she
loved
it
no
no
its
just
i
was
um
i
was
with
ross
and
jill
after
you
left
and
im
pretty
sure
i
saw
a
little
spark
between
them
what
yeah
i
mean
its
probably
nothing
but
i
just
wanted
to
warn
you
that
there
might
be
something
there
with
ross
and
jill
yeah
with
ross
and
my
sister
yeah
with
my
sister
jill
and
my
exboyfriend
ross
yeah
oh
there
is
no
way
okay
then
oh
my
god
i
cannot
believe
that
i
dont
really
like
it
when
ross
goes
out
with
anyone
but
my
sister
isnt
that
like
incest
or
something
oh
my
god
and
theyre
gonna
have
sex
oh
no
what
if
he
marries
her
too
oh
this
is
just
terrible
this
is
just
terrible
and
i
cant
stop
it
i
dont
own
ross
you
know
and
jill
she
should
be
able
to
do
whatever
it
is
she
wants
to
do
oh
my
god
i
cant
believe
ross
is
marrying
my
little
sister
this
is
just
oh
my
god
this
is
just
the
worst
thing
that
couldve
ever
happened
to
me
