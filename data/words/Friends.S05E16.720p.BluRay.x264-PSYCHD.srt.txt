whered

would
you
mind
giving
me
and
ross
a
hand
moving
his
couch
aw
id
love
to
but
i
got
acting
class
but
you
know
what
i
guess
i
could
blow
that
off
for
you
thanks
uh
let
me
ask
you
something
i
was
talking
with
monica
and
chandler
boy
they
are
really
tight
i
know
thats
not
a
bad
situation
they
got
over
there
mmmm
thinking
of
getting
me
one
of
those
whats
up
joe
the
reason
i
think
monica
and
chandler
are
so
great
is
because
they
were
friends
first
you
know
so
i
asked
myself
who
are
my
friends
you
and
phoebe
i
saw
you
first
so
heh
mmhm
what
are
you
saying
im
saying
maybe
you
and
i
crank
it
up
a
notch
you
know
honey
um
as
uh
flattered
as
i
am
that
you
saw
me
first
uh
i
just
dont
think
we
should
be
cranking
anything
up
ill
treat
you
real
nice
oh
yeah
well
you
know
um
listen
i
think
its
a
great
idea
to
become
friends
with
someone
before
you
date
but
i
think
the
way
you
do
it
is
you
meet
someone
become
their
friend
build
a
foundation
then
ask
them
out
on
a
date
dont
hit
on
your
existing
friends
wont
that
take
longer
yeah
yeah
oh
but
once
you
find
it
its
so
worth
the
wait
yeah
i
understand
good
man
i
wish
i
saw
phoebe
first
come
here
to
me
no
no
you
come
here
to
me
hey
ross
ahem
i
brought
reinforcements
oh
great
you
brought
joey
i
brought
the
next
best
thing
heh
hey
you
brought
chandler
the
next
best
thing
would
be
monica
i
would
be
offended
but
monica
is
freakishly
strong
so
look
i
drew
a
sketch
of
how
well
do
it
rach
thats
you
thats
the
couch
