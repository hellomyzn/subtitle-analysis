i
was
just
thinking
about
us
and
how
great
it
was
and
well
i
know
its
been
three
years
but
i
was
kind
of
hoping
we
could
hook
up
again
you
know
i
barely
had
the
nerve
to
make
this
call
so
you
know
what
i
did
what
i
got
a
little
drunk
and
naked
bob
here
so
uh
what
have
you
been
up
to
oh
you
know
the
usual
teaching
aerobics
partying
way
too
much
heh
oh
and
in
case

were
wondering
those
are
my
legs
on
the
new
james
bond
poster

you
hold

the
next

lets
take
a
look
oh
its
like
a
skit
why
its
dinner
for
six
five
steaks
and
an
eggplant
for
phoebe
we
switched
meat
suppliers
at
work
and
they
gave
me
the
steaks
as
a
thankyou
but
wait
theres
more
hey
chandler
what
is
in
that
envelope
by
the
way
this
didnt
seem
so
dorky
out
in
the
hall
come
on
why
its
six
tickets
to
hootie
and
the
blowfish
the
blowfish
its
on
us
all
right
so
dont
worry
this
is
our
treat
so
thank
you
could
you
be
less
enthused
look
its
a
nice
gesture
it
is
but
it
just
feels
like
like
charity
charity
were
just
trying
to
do
a
nice
thing
here
but
ross
you
have
to
understand
your
nice
thing
makes
us
feel
about
this
big
actually
it
makes
us
feel
that
big
what
i
dont
understand
i
mean
its
like
we
cant
win
with
you
guys
if
you
guys
feel
this
big
maybe
thats
not
our
fault
maybe
thats
just
how
you
feel
oh
now
youre
telling
us
how
we
feel
we
never
should
have
talked
about
this
im
gonna
pass
on
the
concert
because
im
just
not
in
a
very
hootie
place
right
now
me

me
too
guys
we
bought
the
tickets
well
then
youll
have
extra
seats
you

for
all
your
tiaras

have
to
do
everything

grab
my
jacket
and
tell
you
i
had
sex
today

you
had
sex
today
wow
it
sounds
even
cooler
when
somebody
else
says
it
i
was
awesome
okay
she
was
biting
her
lip
to
stop
from
screaming
wow
now
i
know
its
been
a
while
but
i
took
that
as
a
good
sign
still
doing
the
screening
thing
i
had
sex
today
i
never
have
to
answer
that
phone
again
here
comes
the
beep
you
know
what
to
do
hey

just
wanted
to
tell
you
i
was
really
hurt
when

a
guy
bob
here

uh
you
met
someone
huh
yes
yes
i
did
in

with
him
two
hours
ago
so
uh
how
was
he
eh
eh
oh
bob
he
was
nothing
compared
to
you
i
had
to
bite
my
lip
to
keep
from
screaming
your
name
well
that
makes
me
feel
so
good
it
was
just
so
awkward
and
bumpy
bumpy
maybe
he
had
some
kind
of
uh
new
cool
style
that
youre
not
familiar
with
and
uh
maybe
you
have
to
get
used
to
it

get
used
to
it
