you
hey
pheebs
hey
if
you
want
to
get
joey
a
gift
that

entire
building
why

something
more
subtle
like
a
wrecking
ball
or
a
vial
of
smallpox
to
release
in
the
hallway
its
not
just
the
drum
noise
every
five
minutes
joey
throws
his
sticks
in
the
air
and
i
have
to
hear
oh
my
eye
oh
god
my
eye
i
mean
its
so
annoying
yes

you
you
see
this
is
how
normal
people
are
supposed
to
react
to
drums
you
got
joey
drums
to
annoy
rachel
so
she
wouldnt
want
to
live
there
anymore
maybe
on

level
you
could
just
not
throw
the
sticks
up
in
the
air

rock
n
roll
about
that

into
two
bedrooms

where
im
going

one
huge
room

not
be
comfortable
with
that
oh
yeah
starting
to
feel
her
again
there
are
we
a
little
bit
yeah

rachel
the
purple
chair

miracle
was
that
that
little
bit
of
oil
that
should
have
lasted
just
one
day
burned
for
eight
whole
days
thats
right
and
thats
why
we
celebrate
hanukkah
today
the
end

that
part
