about
she

first
i
would
like
to
say
thank
you
for
agreeing
to
see
me
again
thats
uh
quite
all
right
but
i
feel
obligated
to
tell
you
that
this
meeting
is
being
videotaped
okay
um
well
first
i
would
like
to
start
by
apologizing
for
kissing
you
and
uh
for
yelling
at
you
fair
enough
now
youre
probably
going
to
hire
one
of
the
people
who
uh
who
did
who
did
not
um
ahem
yell
at
you
and
storm
out
and
i
think
thats
a
big
mistake
and
heres
why
i
made
a
huge
fool
of
myself
and
i
came
back
that
shows
courage
when
i
thought
you
wanted
sex
in
exchange
for
this
job
i
said
no
that
shows
integrity
and
i
was
not
afraid
to
stand
up
for
myself
and
that
shows
courage
okay
ahem
now
i
know
that
ive
already
said
courage
but
youve
got
to
have
courage
and
um
finally
when
i
thought
you
were
making
sexual
advances
in
the
workplace
i
said
no
and
i
was
not
litigious
so
there
you
go
you
got
courage
you
got
integrity
you
got
courage
again
and
not
litigious
look
mr
zelner
zelner

knew
that
oh
i
knew
that

regret
this
but
uh
im
gonna
give
you
a
shot

of
took
a
detour
on
our
way
over
here
we
were
strolling
through
the
park
and
no
one
was
around
so
you
didnt
we
did
ha
ha
we
violated
section
paragraph
of
the
criminal
code
the
park
huh
ha
ha
public
place
uhhuh
i
hear
you
can
you
excuse
me
for
a
second
hi
chandler
monica
this
is
the
mens
room
isnt
it
yes
it
is
but
see
ive
always
found
the
mens
bathroom
very
sexual
havent
you
no
and
if
i
did
i
dont
think
wed
be
going
out
this
is
getting
ridiculous
come
on
we
cant
let
them
win
uh
weve
proved
that
we
are
hot
okay
so
why
are
you
obsessed
about
this
phoebe
and
gary
are
in
that
cant
keep
their
hands
off
each
other
phase
so
so
it
makes
me
really
sad
that
were
not
really
there
anymore
oh
is
that
what
this
has
all
been
about
wasnt
it
a
lot
more
exciting
when
we
were
you
know
all
over
each
other
all
the
time
yeah
that
was
great
that
was
really
great
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
im
more
excited
about
where
we
are
now
really
yeah
ive
never
been
in
a
relationship
thats
lasted
this
long
before
to
get
past
the
beginning
and
still
want
to
be
around
each
other
i
think
thats
pretty
incredible
and
the
fact
that
this
is
happening
with
you
i
think
thats
pretty
exciting
thats
so
sweet
i
know
that
i
was
acting
a
little
crazy
but
i
feel
the
same
way
mm
you
know
what
i
just
realized
you
just
freaked
out
about
our
relationship
pfft
i
did
not
yes
you
did
admit
it
you
freaked
out
i
freaked
out
a
little
a
little
you
freaked
out
bigtime
okay
and
i
fixed
it
we
have
switched
places
i
am
the
relationship
king
and
you
are
the
crazy
irrational
screwup
and
now
were
back
i
cannot
believe
ross
is
buying
this
thank
god
i
cant
watch
him
anymore
hahaha
you
guys
ready
for
the
movies
