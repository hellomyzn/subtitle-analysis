a
very
difficult
year
what
with
the
robbery
and
all
when
that
guy
was
robbing
us
and
i
was
locked
in
the
entertainment
unit
for
six
hours
do
you
know
what
i
was
doing
i
was
thinking
about
how
i
let
you
down
wow
yeah
if
id
have
known
what
kind
of
friend
you
were
gonna
be
i
wouldnt
have
worried
see
you
around
all
right
wait
come
on
just
wait
one
second
there
has
to
be
something
that
i
can
do
if
we
still
had
that
unit
i
would
get
in
there
for
six
hours
and
think
about
how
i
let
you
down
what
we
got
a
box
i
remember
the
last
time
i
saw
you
it
was
the
morning
i
left
for
college
you
were
just
standing
outside
the
dairy
queen
heh
just
probably
waiting
for
it
to
open
gotta
tell
you
you
look
great
now
you
look
great
too
youre
an
excellent
patient
so
how
does
it
look
youve
got
a
little
scratch
on
your
cornea
youre
gonna
have
to
wear
a
patch
like
a
pirate
if
that
helps
you
ahem
so
how
long
have
you
been
working
with
your
dad
come
on
one
of
us
had
to
mention
him
i
moved
back
here
a
couple
months
ago
ah
big
family
dinner
tonight
uh
no
way
i
was
gonna
have
thanksgiving
at
my
girlfriends
oh
but
we
broke
up
oh
she
wasnt
ready
for
a
serious
commitment
oh
so
you
made
her
walk
the
plank
aye
matey
youre
not
wearing
the
patch
yet
i
know
hes
coming
here
for
thanksgiving
i
know
its
sick
why
is
it
sick
because
its
richards
son
its
like
inviting
a
greek
tragedy
over
for
dinner
i
mean
come
on
phoebe
you
understand
dont
you
yeah
i
could
see
where
id
be
your
best
shot
but
no
sorry
honey
i
think
its
twisted
yeah
whats
twisted
oh
me
going
out
with
richards
son
ew
ew
ew
ew
it
sounds
like
a
really
bad
idea
to
me
is
he
okay
in
there
hes
fine
you
know
if
things
work
out
between
you
and
richards
son
youll
be
able
to
tell
your
kids
that
you
slept
with
their
grandfather
fine
judge
all
you
want
to
but
married
a
lesbian
left
a
man
at
the
altar
fell
in
love
with
a
gay
ice
dancer
threw
a
girls
wooden
leg
in
the
fire
live
in
a
box
so
now
ahem
what
exactly
is
the
point
of
the
box
chandler
the
meaning
of
the
box
is
threefold
one
it
gives
me
the
time
to
think
about
what
i
did

proves
how
much
i
care
about
my
friendship
with
joey
