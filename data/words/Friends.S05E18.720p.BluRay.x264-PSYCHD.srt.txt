im
picking

yeah
weirder
than
his
two
moms
making
out
whoa
whoa
dad
theres
a
dad
in
the
commercial
yeah
the
dad
and
ben
eat
soup

pretend
to
enjoy
it
well
maybe
ill
go
with
you
and
see
if
i
can
audition
as
the
dad
i
mean
who

i
am
okay
lets

godfather
all
right
ha
ha
hey
im
in
theyre

me
audition
really
thats
great
i
know
i
know
one
of
the
casting
ladies
has
actually
seen
me
in
a
play
so
i
steered
clear
of
her
that
kid
looks
familiar
oh
yeah
yeah
hes
done
tons
of
commercials
ive
seen
him
in
sugar
smacks
playstation
and
that
one
for
the
phone
company
in
fact
he
was
so
good
in
that
one
he
actually
convinced
me
to
switch
phone
companies
chandler
was
mad
yeah
well
hes
not
gonna
get
this
one
all
right
ben
is
way
cuter
than
that
kid
i
mean
look
at
him
thats
great
listen
wouldnt
it
be
great
if
i
got
to
play
bens
dad
joey
you
look
nothing
like
ben
i
look
more
like
him
than
you
do
well
i
really
dont
know
you
well
enough
for
you
to
do
that
so
its
down
to
these
two
nancy
i
know
you
like
this
one
and
i
think
i
agree
rachel
what
do
you
think
well
um
that
one
is
pretty
but
i
just
love
this
fabric
sorry
oh
dont
be
thats
part
of
your
job
here
to
give
your
opinions
and
then
i
take
credit
for
them
im
kidding
ha
ha
she
is
kidding
but
dont
ever
disagree
with
her
again
okay
now
im
kidding
oh
ha
ha
oh
what
a
fun
office
i
dont
know
which
one
but
i
do
know
i
need
a
cigarette
so
what
do
you
say
we
take
a
break
go
outside
and
figure
this
out
when
we
come
back
rachel
yeah
you
smoke
no
my
dads
a
doctor
and
he
would
always
tell
me
just
horror
stories
about
ghosts
and
goblins
who
totally
supported
the
princess
right
to
smoke
and
then
they
came
back
from
smoking
and
theyd
made
all
of
the
decisions
without
me
that
doesnt
seem
fair
i
know
its
like
im
being
punished
for
not
having
this
disgusting
poisonous
habit
yeah
it
is
the
best
i
mean
what
if
this
keeps
happening
theyll
be
outside

all
the
decisions

in
my
stupid
clean
air

whole
commercial
thing
you

me
against

the
two
of
us
competing

youre
gonna
let
me
do
this
this
is
my
career
were

you
just
i
just
said
that
so
you
wouldnt
let
ben
do
it
look
ross
if
anyone
should
step
aside
it
should
be
ben
what
chandler
tell
him
well
let
me
get
the
door
first
oh
