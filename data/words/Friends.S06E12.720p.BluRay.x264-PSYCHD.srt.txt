plus
you
get
to
stare
at
rachel

could
be
a
waiter
could
i
use
the

okay
lets
go
all
right
well
each
tell
you
how
we
came
up
with
the
joke
then
you
decide
which
one
of
us
is
telling
the
truth
me
chandler
you
go
first
i
thought
of
the
joke
two
months
ago
at
lunch
with
steve
did
i
meet
him
at
christmas
can
i
finish
my
story
do
you
want
me
to
pick
you
see
i
would
never
snap
at
you
like
that
two
babies
continue
okay
steve
said
he
had
to
go
to
the
doctor
and
his
doctors
name
is
dr
mompey
i
said
dr
monkey
and
that
is
how
the
whole
dr
monkey
thing
came
up
are
you
kidding
okay
look
i
study
evolution
remember
evolution
monkey
into
man
plus
im
a
doctor
and
i
had
a
monkey
im
dr
monkey
im
not
arguing
with
that
all
right
ive
heard
enough
ive
made
my
decision
oh
okay
so
what
do
tell
you
are
both
idiots
the
joke
is
not
funny
and
its
offensive
to
women
and
doctors
and
monkeys
you
shouldnt
argue
over
who
gets
credit
you
should
be
arguing
over
who
gets
blamed
for
inflicting
this
horrible
joke
upon
the
world
now
let
it
go
the
joke
sucks
its
your
joke

high
maintenance
monica
is
a
selfsufficient
together
lady
being
with
her
has
been
like
being
on
a
vacation
and
what
may
be
perceived
as
high
maintenance
is
merely
attention
to
detail
and
generosity
of
spirit
wow
you
know
what
that
is
the
best
fake
speech
i
think
ive
ever
heard
