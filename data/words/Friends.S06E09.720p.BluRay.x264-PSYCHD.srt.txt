dreamt
that
he
saved
me
from

burning
building

he
was
so
brave
and
so
strong
and
its
making
me
look

know
dad
chandler
is
one
of
ross
very
best
friends
ross
sure
is
a
great
guy
you
know
ive
always
felt
that
how
a
young
man
turns
out
is
a
reflection
on
his
father
i
always
thought
that
too
tell
me
what
does
your
father
do
hes
a
headliner
of
a
gay
burlesque
show
rach
youre
killing
us

a
little
bit
more

then
i
put
whipped
cream
on
top
what
was
the
one
right
before
bananas
the
beef

put
very
strange
things

their
food
by
the
