ah
i

but
i
quit
smoking
good
for
you
you
look
like
youre

well
i
guess
your
mugging
days
are
behind
you
oh
oh
my
god
phoebe
you
used
to
mug
people
excuse
me
ross
old
friends
catching
up
howd
the
audition
go
they
wanna
see
me
again
but
uh
boy
leonard
hayes
did
not
like
me
what
happened
oh
he
said
i
wasnt
urgent
enough
everything
i
did
was
horizontal
and
i
should
be
more
vertical
oh
and
he
said
that
i
should
think
less
well
so
far
so
good
honey
im
old
whats
wrong
i
am
so
much
older
than
these
other
interns
i
cant
compete
with
them
so
youre
a
little
older
look
at
the
positive
you
have
all
this
life
experience
yes
but
i
dont
think
life
experience
is
gonna
help
me
with
these
wow
its
like
theyre
on
fire
ooh
what
are
they
prototype
sneakers
i
need
ideas
on
how
to
sell
them
which
i
cant
do
because
no
selfrespecting
adult
would
ever
wear
these
ill
give
you
for
them
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
come
on
sneakers
are
easy
you
wear
them
all
the
time
theyre
not
called
sneakers
anymore
theyre
called
kicks
or
skids
i
think
i
heard
somebody
say
slorps
theyve
got
wheels
that
pop
out
from
the
bottom
so
you
can
roll
around
because
apparently
walking
is
too
much
exercise
kids
kids
roll
your
way
to
childhood
obesity
would
you
help
me
try
to
sell
these
okay
have
you
considered
using
a
girl
with
huge
knockers
thats
not
what
theyre
looking
for
hey
that
would
work
on
me
why
do
you
think
i
buy
mrs
buttenvorths
hey
hey
hey
youll
never
guess
what
just
happened
phoebe
and
i
got
mugged
are
you
okay
yeah
because
phoebe
knew
the
mugger
how
do
you
know
a
mugger
im
sorry
i
have
friends
outside
the
six
of
us
know
how
she
knew
him
because
phoebe
used
to
mug
people
seriously
well
im
not
proud
of
it
but
you
know
when
i
was
living
on
the
street
and
i
needed
money
for
food
and
stuff
that
is
awful
i
wasnt
rich
like
you
guys
okay
i
didnt
eat
gold
and
have
a
flying
pony
i
had
a
hard
life
my
mother
was
killed
by
a
drug
dealer
your
mother
killed
herself
she
was
a
drug
dealer
it
was
a
good
thing
phoebe
knew
him
i
was
about
to
do
some
serious
damage
okay
this
must
have
brought
back
some
bad
memories
for
you
ross
why
well
ross
was
mugged
as
a
kid
you
were
yeah
and
it
was
pretty
traumatic
it
was
outside
st
marks
comics
i
was
minding
my
business
seeing
what
kind
of
trouble
spiderman
got
into
ahem
wonder
woman
ahem
anyway
i
was
heading
towards
this
bakery
to
pick
up
a
couple
of
dozen
linzer
tortes
for
someone
when
out
of
nowhere
this
thug
with
a
pipe
jumps
out
and
says
give
me
your
money
punk
oh
my
god
i
know
and
the
worst
part
was
they
took
my
backpack
which
had
all
the
original
artwork
i
had
done
for
my
own
comic
book
science
boy
oh
yeah
what
was
his
superpower
again
a
superhuman
thirst
for
knowledge
i
better
get
to
class
are
there
any
more
of
your
friends
i
should
look
out
for
on
my
way

might
wanna
stay
away
from
jane
street
thats
where
stabby
joe
works

have
a
problem
here

back
in
my
mugging
days

um
worked
st
marks
comics
yeah
well
a
pipe
was
my
weapon
of
choice
and
um
preteen
comicbook
nerds
were
my
meat
so
there
was
one
kid
who
had
a
sticker
on
his
backpack
that
said
geology
rocks
oh
my
god

nuts
for
your
feet
hey

probably
wondering
what
im
doing
ha
ha
no
that
seems
about
right
yesterday
at
my

apparently
that
makes
me
a
good
actor
i

a
callback
so
im
drinking
everything
oh
by
the
way
mmhm
that
eggnog
in
our
fridge
was
great
joey
that
was
formula
we
gotta
get
more
of
that
these
arent
half
bad

suggest
these
to
ralph
lauren
okay
first
of
all
thats
stupid
second
im
not
allowed
to
talk
to
ralph
all
right
i
feel
younger
already
yeah
i
think
i
broke
my
hip
hey
you
hey
hey
how
was
class
no
one
ever
asks
me
that
whats
wrong
nothing
i
really
wanna
know
oh
uh
well
there
was
actually
a
rather
lively
discussion
about
the
pleistocene
all
right
nothing
is
worth
this
um
i
have
a
confession
to
make
um
okay
you
know
that
um
girl
that
mugged
you
when
you
were
a
kid
what
are
you
talking
about
it
wasnt
a
girl
it
was
this
huge
dude
you
dont
have
to
lie
anymore
i
know
that
it
was
a
girl
no
it
wasnt
yes
it
was
no
it
wasnt
you
dont
think
i
would
have
defended
myself
against
a
give
me
your
money
punk
oh
my
god
it
was
you
i
cant
believe
it
you
mugged
me
yeah
and
im
so
so
sorry
ross
im
sorry
but
you
know
if
you
think
about
it
its
kind
of
neat
i
mean
well
its
just
that
ive
always
felt
kind
of
like
an
outsider
you
know
the
rest
of
you
have
these
connections
that
go
way
back
and
you
know
now
you
and
i
have
a
great
one
its
not
the
best
i
know
please
forgive
me
i
dont
know
what
to
say
theres
nothing
you
can
say
that
was
the
most
humiliating
thing
ever
really
even
more
humiliating
than
lets
not
do
this
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
commercial
the
girls
get
out
of
the
hot
tub
and
start
making
out
with
each
other
huh
huh
huh
thats
interesting
just
one
thought
you
didnt
mention
the
shoes
whos
next
chandler
okay
you
start
on
the
image
of
a
guy
putting
on
the
shoes
hes
about
my
age
pfft
your
age
uhhuh
so
hes
rolling
down
the
street
and
he
starts
to
lose
control
maybe
he
falls
maybe
he
hurts
himself
just
then
a
kid
comes
flying
by
wearing
the
shoes
he
jumps
over
the
old
guy
and
laughs
and
the
line
reads
not
suitable
for
adults
well
chandler
thats
great
oh
thank
you
sir
or
man
whos
two
years
younger
than
me
you
see
that

a
clear
selling
point
it
appeals
to
our
key
demographic

did
you
come
up
with
that
i
dont
know
i
dont
know
i
was
just
trying
to
get
into
a
young
mindset

stuff
started
to
flow

of
you
