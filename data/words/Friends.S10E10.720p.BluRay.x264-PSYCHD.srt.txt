whoa

whoa
phoebe
you

take
her
i
know
i
said
some
bad
stuff
but
rachel
does
have
some
qualities
that
make
her
a
good
roommate
she
gets
tons
of
catalogs
and
um
shell
fold
down
the
pages
of
the
things
she
thinks
id
like
what
else
uh
when
i
take
a
shower
she
leaves
me
little
notes
on
the
mirror
yeah
i
do
i
do
do
that
thats
nice
i
like
having
things
to
read
in
the
bathroom
when
i
fall
asleep
on
the
couch
after
reading
she
covers
me
over
with
a
blanket
well
you
know
i
dont
want
you
to
be
cold
and
when
i
told
her
i
was
gonna
move
in
with
chandler
she
was
really
supportive
you
were
so
great
you
made
it
so
easy
and
now
you
have
to
leave
and
i
have
to
live
with
a
boy
hey
she
really
left
i
know
thank
you
no
problem
roomie
can
i
ask
you
a
question
sure
what
the
hell
is
that
dog
doing
here
a
little
toast
here
ding
ding
ding
mm
this
isnt
exactly
the
kind
of
thanksgiving
you
planned
but
for
me
this
has
been
really
great
you
know
i
think
because
it
didnt
involve
divorce
or
projectile
vomiting
i
was
just
thinking
if
youd
gone
to
vail
or
if
you
guys
had
been
with
your
family
or
if
you
didnt
have
syphilis
and
stuff
we
wouldnt
be
all
together
you
know
so
i
guess
what
im
trying
to
say
is
that
im
very
thankful
that
all
of
your
thanksgivings
sucked
thats
so
sweet
thank
you
