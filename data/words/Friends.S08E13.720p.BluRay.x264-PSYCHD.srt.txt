lets

i
actually
had
the
weirdest
conversation
with
joey
he
was
talking
about
rules
and
right
and
wrong
i
had
the
same
conversation
what
was
he
talking
about
he
hasnt
had
this
much
trouble
getting
out
words
since
he
was
in
macbeth
that
was
a
long
night
what
exactly
did
he
say
to
you
he
was
talking
about
rules
and
looking
at
people
differently
not
to
me
whatd
he
tell
you
he
asked
about
you
me
and
london
and
the
glue
that
holds
this
all
together
the
rules
okay
so
you
me
and
london
looking
at
people
differently
maybe
he
wants
to
do
what
you
and
i
did
in
london
but
whatd
he
mean
by
rules
wait
he
stopped
talking
the
minute
phoebe
came
in
hes
looking
at
her
differently
phoebe
is
his
friend
thatd
be
breaking
the
rules

to
do
it
with
phoebe
in
london
