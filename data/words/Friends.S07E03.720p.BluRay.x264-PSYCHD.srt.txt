that
joey
i
could
teach

yeah
ive
been
sailing
my
whole
life
when
i
was
my
dad
bought
me
my
own
boat
your
own
boat
he
was
trying
to
cheer
me
up
my

did
you
correct

i
thought
it

be
more
fun
this
way
maybe
this
is
something
you
could
do
this
every
week
or
you
could
sit
on
the
porch
and
make
sure
no
one
steals
the
trashcans
he
does
that
every
week
too
just
so
you

have
to
let
him
win
he
hates
to
lose

that
part
listen
im
sure
dad
doesnt
care
he
probably
thought
this
was
funny
hell
be
telling
this
story
for
years
i
dont
want
him
to
tell
this
story
for
years
oh
but
he
will
he
still
tells
the
story
about
how
monica
tried
to
escape
from
fat
camp
i
wasnt
escaping
then
howd
you
get
caught
in
the
barbed
wire
i
was
trying
to
help
out
a
