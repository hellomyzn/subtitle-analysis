we

gathered
here
today
to
join
this
man
and
this
woman
in
the
bonds
of
holy
matrimony
ive
known
monica
and
chandler
for
a
long
time
and
i
cant
imagine
two
people
more
perfect
for
each
other
and
now
as
ive
left
my
notes
in
my
dressing
room
we
shall
proceed
to
the
vows
monica
he
took
off
go
on
go
on
chandler
for
so
long
i
wondered
if
i
would
ever
find
my
prince
my
soul
mate
then
three
years
ago
at
another
wedding
i
turned
to
a
friend
for
comfort
and
instead
i
found
everything
that
id
been
looking
for
my
whole
life
and
now
here
we
are
with
our
future
before
us
and
i
only
want
to
spend
it
with
you
my
prince
my
soul
mate
my
friend
unless
you
dont
want
to
you
go
chandler
no
thats
okay
i
thought
this
would
be
the
most
difficult
thing
i
ever
had
to
do
but
when
i
saw
you
walking
down
that
aisle
i
realized
its
simple
i
love
you
any
surprises
that
come
our
way
its
okay
because
i
will
always
love
you
you
are
the
person
i
was
meant
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
with
you
want
to
know
if
im
sure
you
may
now
kiss
the
bride
so
i
guess
by
the
powers
vested
in
me
by
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
internet

now
pronounce
you
husband
and

other

pronounce
you

and
wife
