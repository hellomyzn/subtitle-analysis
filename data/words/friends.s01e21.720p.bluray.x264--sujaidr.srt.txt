uh
san
diego
right
but
that
may
just
be
a
pipe
dream
because
hes
outofstate

thats
a
possibility
but
thats
two
blocks
from
the
beach

some
cheerleader
take
off
their
hats
popes
in
a
volkswagen
mmhm
i
love
that
joke
no
way
no
way

you

this
monana
was
very
brave
it
was
so
wild
we
told
them
we
were
the
gunnersons
in
room
only
to
find
out
the
boston
celtics
had
the
entire
sixth
floor
so
when
they
caught
on
to
the
fact
that
were
short
and
have
breasts
they
threw
us
out
i
was
thrown
out
of
a
hotel
me
go
monana
well

not
the
only
ones
living
the
dream
i
get

the
way
tomorrow

auditioning
for
a
broadway
show

memories
and
make
complete
fools
of
ourselves
what
do
you
say
no
no
no
remember
who
youre
dealing
with
here
ha
im
not
like
you
i
cant
even
stand
in
front
of
a
tap
class
thats
because
of
your
amish
background
what
well
youre
pennsylvania
dutch
right
right
till
i
bought
a
blow
dryer
then
i
was
shunned
i
was
just
like
you
and
then
one
day
i
saw
a
movie
that
changed
my
life
did
you
ever
see
dead
poets
society
uhhuh
i
thought
that
movie
was
so
incredibly
boring
i
mean
that
thing
at
the
end
where
the
kid
kills
himself
because
he
cant
be
in
the
play
what
was
that
its
like
kid
wait
a
year
leave
home
do
some
community
theater
i
walked
out
of
there
and
i
thought
now
thats
two
hours
of
my
life
that
im
never
getting
back
and
that
scared
me
more
than
all
the
other
crap
i
was
afraid
to
do
wow
then
i
would
definitely
not
recommend
mrs
doubtfire
