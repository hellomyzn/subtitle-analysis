being
serviced
by
a
policeman
youre
not
gonna
actually
send
these
out
are
you
actually
i

ross
is
dead
joke
didnt
work
okay
there
were
no
responses
nobody
posted
anything
on
the
website
nobody
called

you
talking
about
you
get
responses
just
for
coming
out
of
the
closet
i
didnt
get
one
response
and
im
dead
well
the
gay
community
is
a
lot
more
vocal
than
the
dead
community
i
cant
believe
this
not
even
my
geology
lab
partner
and
i
carried
that
guy
all
right
look
lets
think
about
this
okay
you
think
people
are
gonna
disturb
your
family
at
this
tragic
time
that
people
are
gonna
post
condolences
on
a
website
this
isnt
about
people
not
caring
that
youre
dead
this
is
about
people
not
having
a
decent
outlet
for
their
grief
youre
right
there
isnt
a
decent
outlet
right
come
on
im
sure
if
you
had
a
funeral
or
memorial
service
tons
of
people
would
come
exactly
ross
what
are
you
doing
youre
having
a
memorial
service
for
yourself
no
that
would
be
stupid
youre
having
it
for
me
ross

fine
its
original
huggsy
i
know
emma
wants
him
but
hes
mine
and
i
need

shes
being
unreasonable
joey
there
is
a
reason
that
emma
loves
that
stupid
penguin
so
much
oh
dont
cover
its
ears
its
because
it
reminds
her
of
her
uncle
joey
it
does
yeah
and
shes
comforted
by
him
because
she
loves
her
uncle
joey
so
much
really
she
loves
me
oh
yeah
but
you
know
what
if
you
need
huggsy
dont
worry
emma
will
totally
understand
i
wont
but
whatever
okay
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute

i
mean
if
if
huggsy
means
that
much
to
emma

have
him

i
knew
uncle
joey
would
step
up

kori
weston
yeah
you

amazing
and
you
are
chandler
chandler
bing
and
im
not
gay
im
not
gay
at
all
you
are
married
though
dont
listen
to
him
hes
in
a
really
bad
mood
i
cant
believe
that
ross
is
gone
it
is
just
so
sad
i
didnt
know
ross
and
you
were
so
close
oh
we
werent
but
we
had
one
class
together
he
was
such
a
great
guy
and
he
talked
so
passionately
about
science
i
always
remembered
him
im
sure
that
would
mean
a
lot
to
him
and
if
heaven
has
a
door
im
sure
hes
pressing
his
ear
up
against
it
and
listening
intently
i
thought
so
many
times
about
calling
him
and
asking
him
out
i
guess
i
really
missed
my
chance
no
you
didnt
im
still
alive
kori
i
know
this
is
a
big
surprise
for
you
its
a
long
story
but
the
things
you
just
said
really
made
my
day
the
fact
that
youre
here
means
more
to
me
than
if
this
room
were
filled
with
people
you
sick
freak
who
does
that
i
cant
believe
i
had
a
crush
on
you
did
you
hear
that
kori
weston
had
a
crush
on
me
no
mom
i
am
not
dead
i
know
its
not
something
to
kid
about
it
was
just
a
practical
joke
between
chandler
and
me
but
its
over
okay
actually
no
even
if
i
had
died
you
would
not
be
left
childless
