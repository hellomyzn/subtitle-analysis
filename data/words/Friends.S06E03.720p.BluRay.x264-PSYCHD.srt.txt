i
talk
about
her
all
the
time
denise
rach
i
was
thinking
im
gonna

about
naked
thursdays
right
yeah
yeah
i
think
im
gonna
find
my
own
place
hey
hey
i
thought
naked
thursdays
was
just
our
thing
man
hey
hey
what
did
rachel
say
when
you
told
her
you
were
still
married
to
her
oh
that
um
she
took
it
really
well
oh
you
didnt
tell
her
did
you
no
because
youre
in
love
with
her
i
am
not
in
love
with
her
she
was
very
upset
about
having
to
move
out
so
i
didnt
tell
her
we
were
still
married
because
shed
only
get
more
upset
i
comforted
her
as
a
friend
what
do
you
mean
comforted
her
it
was
nothing
i
gave
her
a
hug
aha
a
classic
sign
of
love
the
hug
its
also
a
sign
of
friendship
yeah
not
in
your
case
lovey
loverson
it
was
a
hug
just
tell
me
this
did
you
or
did
you
not
smell
her
hair
smell
her
hair
well
what
if
i
did
ninety
percent
of
a
womans
pheromones
come
out
the
top
of
her
head
thats
why
women
are
shorter
so
that
men
will
fall
in
love
when
they
hug
them
come
on
ross
youre
a
scientist
i
was
hugging
her
as
a
friend
okay
its
not
my
fault
her
hair
got
in
my
face
shes
got
a
lot
of
it
and
it
smells
all
uh
you
know
coconutty
what
oh
it
doesnt
mean
i
have
feelings
for
rachel
maybe
it
means
i
have
feelings
for
coconuts
okay
whatever
you
say
but
just
be
careful
rachels
not
in
the
same
place
you
are
okay
if
the
place
youre
referring
to
is
being
in
love
then
she
is
in
the
same
place
as
me
because
i
am
not
in
that
place
okay
i
didnt
understand
that
but
maybe
thats
because
you
were
speaking
the
secret
language
of
love
hey
hey
dude
some
guy
just
called
for
you
who
was
it
i
dont
know
how
about
thanks
for
taking
the
message
jeez
hey
listen
when
you
move
in
rachels
rooms
gonna
be
empty
you
wanna
talk
about
what
we
wanna
do
with
it
sure
okay
i
think
we
should
have
a
beautiful
guest
room
with
a
mahogany
sleigh
bed
and
bedside
tables
with
flowers
on
them
then
we
could
have
a
rolltop
desk
with
comment
cards
so
people
can
tell
us
how
much
they
love
staying
here
whatever
you
know
i
really
havent
thought
about
it
that
much
well
i
like
that
idea
obviously
ha
ha
but
i
was
thinking
maybe
it
could
be
a
game
room
you
know
i
mean
you
can
buy
old
arcade
games
like
space
invaders
and
asteroids
for
the
real
ones
the
big
big
big
ones
no
okay
so
you
mean
no
as
in
gee
chandler
what
an
interesting
idea
lets
discuss
it
before
we
reject
it
completely
oh
im
sorry
of
course
yes
interesting
idea
um
talk
about
it
but
no
so
thats
it
well
i
just
dont
think
that
arcade
games
go
in
the
beautiful
guest
room
the
guest
rooms
gonna
be
filled
with
antiques
which
is
why
asteroids
is
perfect
its
the
oldest
game
what
do
you
have
against
the
guest
room
i
dont
have
anything
against
the
guest
room
especially
since
everybody
that
we
know
lives
about
seconds
away
are
you
mocking
me
no
im
not
mocking
you
or
your
beautiful
guest
room

to
enjoy
the
room
totally
we

watch
two
people
i
care
about

be
hurt
by
something
that
is
so
silly
i

very
good
points

a
long
time
and
ive
never
seen
either
of
you
onemillionth
as
happy
as
youve
been
since
you
got
together
do
you
really
wanna
throw
that
all
away
over
a
room
that
is
so
silly
whats
more
important
love
or
silliness
well
we
are
fond
of
the
silliness
but
we
also
have
a
soft
spot
for
the
love
love
is
the
best
medicine
thats
laughter
why
do
you
do
it
i
dont
know
now
chandler

live
with
monica

live
with
chandler

you
yes
good
a
verbal
contract

binding
in
the
state
of
new
york
so
i
understand
youre
looking
for
a
place
no
no
im
staying
put
oh
i
was
going
to
offer
you
my
apartment
why
where
are
you
going
i
dont
know
hey
rach
hi
uh
youre
never
gonna

the
bright
side
we
get
to
be
roommates

yeah
you
know
about
that
um
ross
ahem
i
really
appreciate
your
offer
to
let
me
move
in
and
everything
but
dont
you
think
its
gonna
be
weird
why
why
why
would
it
why
would
it
be
weird
well
you
know
because
of
us
because
of
our
history
no
no
no
no
it
would
only
be
weird
if
we
were
still
in
that
place
i
mean
are
you
still
in
that
place
no
not
at
all
good
me
neither
so
its
not
a
problem
were
just
two
friends
who
happen
to
be
roommates
okay
but
ross
eventually
you
and
i
are
gonna
be
dating
really
we
are
well
yeah
im
gonna
have
a
boyfriend
and
youre
gonna
have
a
girlfriend
oh
heh
thatd
be
great
but
if
you
think
its
gonna
be
okay
well
just
work
out
a
system
itll
be
like
in
college
ill
hang
a
hanger
on
the
door
and
put
a
sign
come
back
later
im
getting
lucky
yeah
i
didnt
think
of
that
so
are
you
sure
about
this
whole
movingin
thing
i
mean
its
a
really
big
step
and
whats
the
rush
thats
very
funny
hes
being
silly
because
he
knows
we
enjoy
the
silliness
no
im
serious
okay
i
mean
think
about
it
you
move
in
you
start
fighting
over
stupid
game
rooms
next
thing
you
know
you
break
up
ross
you
were
right
before
it
was
just
a
stupid
fight
about
a
room
okay
there
are
no
stupid
fights
this
isnt
about
the
room
this
is
about
what
the
room
represents
and
unfortunately
this
room
could
destroy
you
yeah
im
not
so
worried
yeah
no
me
neither
fine
its
your
life
i
just
dont
wanna
see
you
break
up
which
you
will
do
if
you
move
in
together
but
if
thats
what
you
want
theres
nothing
i
can
do
dont
do
it
you
still
wanna
move
in
