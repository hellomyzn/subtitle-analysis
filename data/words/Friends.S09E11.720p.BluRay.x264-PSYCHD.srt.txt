why
does
she
have
a
pink
bow
taped
to
her
head
if
one
more
person
says
what
a
cute
little
boy
im
gonna
whip
them
with
a
car
antenna
i
think
shes
gonna
be
the
hit
of
the
office
huh
yeah
shes
gonna
be
hotter
than
uh
peasant
blouses
and
aline
skirts
can
i
get
a
blue
bow
okay
i
have
looked
through
a
bunch
of
career
guides
photocopied
and
highlighted
key
passages
and
put
them
into
alphabetical
folders
so
you
can
make
an
informed
decision
how
long
was
i
in
there
okay
lets
start
with
the
as
advertising
wait
advertising
thats
a
great
idea
well
dont
you
wanna
look
through
the
rest
i
dont
think
i
have
to
hear
the
rest
advertising
makes
perfect
sense
im
sorry
you
had
to
waste
all
this
time
you
call
eight
hours
alone
with
my
label
maker
wasted
time
ooh
now
ill
get
to
use
my
shredder
i
mean
i
could
write
slogans
i
mean
how
hard
could
it
be
right
cheese
its
milk
that
you
chew
crackers
because
your
cheese
needs
a
buddy
a
grape
because
who
can
get
a
watermelon
in
your
mouth
oh
i
got
one
socks
because
your
familys
feet
deserve
the
best
honey

someone
in
advertising
i
grew
up

i
think
theres
never
gonna
be
a
right
time
to
have
a
baby
now
youre
unemployed
and
in
a
little
while
youll
find
a
new
job
thatll
keep
you
really
busy
theres
always
gonna
be
a
reason
not
to
do
this
but
i
think
once
the
baby
comes
well
forget
about
all
those
reasons
i
guess
i
mean
its
always
gonna
be
scary
when
we
have
a
baby
its
gonna
be
really
scary
i
mean
god
when
we
have
a
baby
theres
gonna
be
so
much
that
were
not
able
to
control
i
mean
the
apartments
gonna
be
a
mess
i
wont
have
time
to
clean
it
what
if
the
baby
gets
into
the
ribbon
drawer
and
messes
up
all
the
ribbons
what
if
theres
no
room
for
a
ribbon
drawer
because
the
babys
stuff
takes
up
all
the
space
where
will
all
the
ribbons
go
should
we
go
make
a
baby
before
you
change
your
mind
yes
please
okay
oh
and
i
promise
i
will
not
fake
it
this
time
well
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
im
a
little
shook
up
i
know
you
botched
that
operation
on
purpose
i
cant
prove
it
yet
but
when
i
do
youll
be
going
to
jail
for
murder
i
dont
care
if
you
are
my
brother
im
not
your
brother
what
about
my
children
drake
huh
no
no
no
no
no
god
