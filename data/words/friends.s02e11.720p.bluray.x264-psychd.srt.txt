take
this
big
pause
where
you
look
all
intense

her
aura
when
it
happened
and
when
her
spirit
left
her
body
i
dont
think
it
went
very
far
what
do

think
it
went
into
me
this
is
so
hard
i
cant
decide
between
lamb
or
duck

scarier
or
the
movie

been
called
silence
of
the
ducks

the
halfdrunk
cappuccino
with
the
lipstick
on
the
rim

barry
honey
and
ive
never

uh
considering

no
idea

i
suppose
to
know
they
were
having
problems
you
know
in
my
day
divorce
was
not
an
option
hey
look
whos
up
i
just
cant
believe
this
is
happening
when
i
was
little
all
parents
got
divorced
i
figured
as
an
adult
i
wouldnt
have
to
worry
about
it
cant
you
look
at
this
as
flattering
she
just
wants
to
be
like
you
well
couldnt
she
have
just
copied
my
haircut
when
my
parents
divorced
they
sent
me
to
a
shrink
and
she
told
me
that
kids
blame
themselves
but
in
your
case
its
actually
kind
of
true
oh

mailorder
grandfather

saying
my
wife
is
in

have
to
believe
me
but
um
can
you
think
of
any
unfinished
business
she
had
any
reason
to
hang
around
i
dont
know
what
to
say
all
i
can
think
of
is
that
she
used
to
say
that
before
she
died
she
wanted
to
see
everything
everything
everything
whoa

a
lot
of
stuff
