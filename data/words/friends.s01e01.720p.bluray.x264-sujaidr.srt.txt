and
joey
and

my

ross
sure
hey
hi
oh
god
sighs
so
you
wanna
tell
us
now
or
are
we
waiting
for
four
wet
bridesmaids
oh
god
well
it
started
about
a
halfhour
before
the
wedding
i
was
in
this
room
with
all
the
presents
and
i
was
looking
at
this
gravy
boat
this
really
gorgeous
limoges
gravy
boat
when
all
of
a
sudden
sweet
n
low
i
realized
i
was
more
turned
on
by
this
gravy
boat
than
by
barry
then
i
got
really
freaked
out
and
thats
when
it
hit
me
how
much
barry
looks
like
mr
potato
head
you
know
i
mean
i
always
knew
he
looked
familiar
but
anyway
i
just
had
to
get
out
of
there
and
i
started
wondering
why
am
i
doing
this
and
who
am
i
doing
this
for
anyway
i
just
didnt
know
where
to
go
and
i
know
you
and
i
have
drifted
apart
but
youre
the
only
person
i
know
in
the
city
who
wasnt
invited
to
the
wedding
oh
i
was
kind
of
hoping
that
wouldnt
be
an
issue
speaking
in
spanish
on
tv
im
guessing
he
bought
her
the
big
pipe
organ
and
shes
really
not
happy
about
it
daddy
i
just
i
cant
marry
him
im
sorry
i
just
dont
love
him
well
it
matters
to
me
chandler
she
should
not
be
wearing
those
pants
i
say
push
her
down
the
stairs
all
push
her
down
the
stairs
push
her
down
the
stairs
all
cheer
and
applaud
come
on
daddy
listen
to
me
its
like
all
of
my
life
everyones
always
told
me
youre
a
shoe
youre
a
shoe
youre
a
shoe
youre
a
shoe
then
today
i
stopped
and
said
what
if
i
dont
wanna
be
a
shoe
what
if
i
wanna
be
a
purse
you
know
or
a
hat
i
dont
want
you
to
buy
me
a
hat
i
am
a
hat
its
a
metaphor
daddy
you
can
see
where
hed
have
trouble
look
daddy
its
my
life
well
maybe
ill
just
stay
here
with
monica

how
clean

breaking
something
valuable
of
hers
say
her
leg
heh
thats
one
way
of
going
through
it
yeah
me
i
went
for
the
watch
you
actually
broke
her
watch
mm
barry
im
sorry
i
am
so
sorry
you
probably
think
its
about
making
love
with
your
socks
on
but
it
isnt
it
isnt
its
about
me
and
i
sighs
hi
machine
cut
me
off
again
anyway
you
know
whats
scary
what
if
theres
only
one
woman
for
everybody
i
mean
what
if
you
get
one
woman
and
thats
it
unfortunately
in
my
case
there
was
only
one
woman
for
her
what
are
you
talking
about
one
woman
thats
like
saying
theres
only
one
flavor
of
ice
cream
for
you
let
me
tell
you
something
ross
theres
lots
of
flavors
out
there
theres
rocky
road
and
cookie
dough
and
bing
cherry
vanilla
you
can
get
them
with
jimmies
or
nuts
or
whipped
cream
this
is
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
you
you
got

you
were
like
what
welcome
back
to
the
world
grab
a
spoon

if
im
hungry
or
horny
then
stay
out
of
my
freezer
ever
since
she
walked
out
on
me
i
what
what
you
wanna
spell
it
out
with
noodles

more
of
a
fifth
date
kind
of
revelation
