slip
her
the
tongue

maybe
maybe
he
could
grab
her
and
lift
her
up
yeah
yeah
then
adrianne
maybe
she
could
wrap
her
legs
around
his
waist
and
then
she
could
rip
off
his
shirt
and
kiss
his
chest
and
his
stomach
and
then
he
could
use
his
teeth
his
teeth
to
undo
her
dress
and
and
bite
her
and
then
right
when
the
scene
ends
he
could
take
her
with

raw
animal
