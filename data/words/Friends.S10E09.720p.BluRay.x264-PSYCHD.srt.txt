the
more
the
better
all

so
youre

uh
if
i

i
might
be
getting
into

why
do
men
keep
talking
to
me
like
this
so
the
fact
that
im
a
doctor
and
my
wifes
a
reverend
thats
important
to
you
yeah
i
read
some
great
applications
but
i
thought
who
better
than
a
minister
to
raise
a
child
amen
plus
i
thought
the
baby
would
be
in
good
hands
with
a
doctor
oh
good
hands
healing
hands
reverend
can
i
ask
does
the
bible
say
anything
about
adoption
it
says
do
it
and
behold
she
did
adopt
unto
them
a
baby
and
it
was
good
wow
yeah
wow
i
was
wondering
you
both
have
such
serious
jobs
would
you
have
time
to
take
care
of
a
baby
and
your
flock
oh
no
my
flock
my
flock
is
good
yeah
my
flock
pretty
much
takes
care
of
themselves
by
this
point
its
a
good
flock
flock
flock
flock
but
being
a
doctor
that
must
take
up
a
lot
of
time
not
for
me
it
doesnt
so
hows
everything
going
in
here
were
great
i
think
i
may
have
asked
all
my
questions
good
do
you
have
questions
for
erica
yeah
actually
so
you
read
a
file
that
you
liked
and
then
you
gave
the
agency
the
serial
number
and
they
contacted
us
oh
yes
our
system
ensures
total
anonymity
were
very
proud
of
it
you
should
be
youre
really
on
top
of
stuff
well
then
if
theres
nothing
else
then
the
two
of
us
should
talk
i
actually
i
dont
think
we
have
to
we
dont
yeah
when
i
read
about
you
two
i
was
pretty
sure
i
wanted
you
but
i
just
thought
we
should
meet
face
to
face
ive
made
my
decision
i
choose
them
heh
oh
my
god
this
is
great
this
is
so
great
did
you
hear
that
yeah
i
did

some
of
the

of
them

hey
so
these
are
the
preliminary
forms
for
an
open
adoption
uh
theres
a
lot
to
go
over
but
ill
explain
as
we
go
through
is
that
a
picture
yeah
its
a
sonogram
they
took
of
the
baby
last
week
i
thought
you
might
wanna
see
it
look
doctor
look
before
we
sign
anything
we
really
have
to
talk
were
not
who
you
think
we
are
i
dont
understand
the
agency
must
have
made
a
mistake
my
wife
is
not
a
reverend
and
im
not
a
doctor
what
thats
impossible
i
could
perform
an
operation
on
you
and
prove
it
if
youd
like
um
i
have
to
check
your
file
excuse
me
so
who
are
you
our
names
really
are
monica
and
chandler
were
from
new
york
yeah
but
the
important
thing
to
know
about
us
is
how
much
we
would
care
for
this
little
baby
so
you
lied
to
me
before
well
we
bore
false
witness
see
i
could
be
a
reverend
i
cant
believe
this
but
we
were
hoping
that
since
we
told
you
the
truth
that
you
still
might
consider
giving
you
my
baby
you
think
id
give
you
my
child
after
this
you
dont
have
to
decide
now
if
you
look
at
our
file
i
dont
wanna
look
at
your
file
this
is
over
erica
wait
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
look
you
have
every
reason
to
be
upset
we
did
lie
but
only
because
weve
been
waiting
and
trying
to
have
a
baby
for
so
long
and
we
dont
know
how
long
its
gonna
be
before
we
get
another
chance
why
dont
you
ask
the
reverend
to
pray
on
it
erica
please
just
consider
us
ask
them
to
see
our
file
our
last
names
bing
my
wifes
a
chef
and
im
in
advertising
oh
yeah
i
actually
liked
you
guys
but
it
doesnt
matter
what
you
did
was
wrong
but
you
did
like
us
and
you
should
my
wifes
an
incredible
woman
she
is
loving
and
devoted
and
caring
and
dont
tell
her
i
said
this
but
the
womans
always
right
i
love
my
wife
more
than
anything
in
this
world
and
it
it
kills
me
that
i
cant
give
her
a
baby
i
really
want
a
kid
and
when
that
day
finally
comes
ill
learn
how
to
be
a
good
dad
but
my
wife
shes
already
there
