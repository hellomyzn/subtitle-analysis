by
the

whats
the

obviously
only
one
of

can
keep

her
obviously
so
how
do
we
decide
well
now
lets
look
at
this
objectively
i
think
i
should

her
uhhuh
uhhuh
or
im
the
one
who
dates
her
thats
interesting
but
check
this
out
i
date
her
yeah
i
like

just
to
go
in
another
direction
okay

why
dont
we
just
let
her
decide
okay
well
each
go
out
with

on
the
banister
again
swing
music
is
so
out
phoebe
hes
gotta
be
in
the

for
that
to
work
what
are
you
guys
talking
about
were
talking
about
the
swing
kings
and
whether
theyre
the
right
way
to
go
i
went
to
a
wedding
where
they
had
swing
music
and
two
months
later
the
couple
divorced
im
not
saying
theres
any
connection
here
but
they
did
tell
me
thats
why
they
got
divorced
but
i
love
swing
music
but
the
swing
kings
they
suck
so
much
that
people
actually
die
at
their
concerts
they
just
stop
living
when
monica
and
i
went
to
see
them
we
had
fun
and
theres
another
reason
well
what
is
the
other
reason
i
dont
want
to
say
well
you
have
to
because
maybe
its
stupid
its
just
while
monica
and
i
were
dancing
to
them
it
was
the
first
time
i
knew
that
you
were
the
woman
that
i
wanted
to
dance

oh
crap
our
table
will
be
ready
in
just
a
few
minutes
oh

is
your
back
feeling
better
yeah

fine
i
guess
ahem
the
more
muscles
you

the
more
they
can
spasm
out
of
control
kristen
joey
hi
hi
what
are
you
doing
here
i
like
this
place
and
technically
technically
im
not
breaking
any
rules
so
well
ross
this
is
joey
joey
ross
hi
hi
its
nice
to
meet
you
i
used
to
have
a
friend
named
joey
i
dont
anymore
our
table
will
be
ready
in
a
couple
minutes
sure
i
would
love
to
wait
with
you
guys
thanks
so
joey
you
look
familiar
are
you
on
tv
or
something
joey
doesnt
like
to
talk
about
it
but
hes
one
of
the
stars
of
days
of
our
lives
thats
right
thats
right
dont
you
play
a
woman
a
woman
in
a
mans
body
much
better
so
ross
its
funny
because
you
look
familiar
to
me
too
have
you
ever
been
married
yes
i
have
in
fact
just
the
other
day
kris
and
i
talked
about
how
ive
been
married
and
have
a
son
yeah
little
eric
thats
right
wait
no
ben
so
youve
just
been
married
the
one
time
then
well
um
youve
been
married
twice
yes
and
another
time
after
that
boy
im
getting
hungry
ahem
hey
joey
have
you
ever
been
so
hungry
on
a
date
that
when
the
girl
goes
to
the
bathroom
you
eat
some
of
her
food
you
said
the
waiter
ate
my
crab
cake
so
ross
now
why
did
that
first
marriage
break
up
hm
was
it
because
the
woman
was
straight
or
because
she
was
a
lesbian
do
you
two
know
each
other
no
but
he
seems
like
a
guy
whod
marry
a
woman
on
the
verge
of
being
a
lesbian
and
then
push
her
over
the
edge
wait
a
minute
were
you
on
a
poster
for
gonorrhea

you
ever
slept
in
the
same
bed
