i
just
i
just
needed
to
know
um
when
did
you
start
to
feel
like
a
father
oh
well
i
guess
it
must
have
been
the
day
after
you
were
born
we
were
in
the
hospital
room
your
mother
was
asleep
and
they
brought
you
in
and
gave
you
to
me
you
were
this
ugly
little
red
thing
chuckles
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
grabbed
my
finger
with
your
whole
fist
and
you
squeezed
it
so
tight
and
thats
when
i
knew
so
you
dont
want
to
go
to
williamsburg
we
can
go
to
williamsburg
eat
your
fish
speaking
in
spanish
knock
on
