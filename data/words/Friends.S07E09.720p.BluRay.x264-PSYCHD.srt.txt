me
to
the
park
and
i
got
on
it
and
it
bent
yeah
i
never
had
a
bike
of
my
own
what
well
we
didnt
have
a
lot
of
money
but
the
girl
across
the
street
had
the
best
bike
it
was
pink
and
it
had
rainbowcolored
tassels
hanging
off
the
handle
grips
and
a
bell
and
this
big
white
wicker
basket
with
those
plastic
daisies
stuck
on
that
sounds
like
my
first
bike
my
dad
gave
me
his
old
one
did
the
girl
ever
let
you
ride
it
no
but
she
gave
me
the
box
that
it
came
in
it
had
a
picture
of
the
bike
on
the
front
so
i
would
sit
on
it
and
my
stepdad
would
drag
me
around
the
backyard

so
unfair
