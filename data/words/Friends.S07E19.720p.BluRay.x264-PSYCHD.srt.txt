voices
you
must
be
chandler
hi
nice
to
meet
you
nice
to
meet
you
too
so
ready
to
go
yeah
chandler
ill
be
right
with
you
cassie
needs
to
stay
at
your
place
why
because
pervie
perverson
here
cant
stop
staring
at
her
chandler
shes
our
cousin
i
wasnt
staring
i
was
listening
intently
its
called
being
a
good
conversationalist
watch
say
something
you
were
staring
about
eight
inches
south
of
there
fine
she
can
stay
at
my
place
what
does
cassie
look
like
now
she
looks
exactly
like
aunt
marilyn
huh
so
this
aunt
marilyn
is
she
coming
to
the
wedding
waferthin
ice
hey
im
back
hi
joey
uh
so
will
i
be
reading
the
same
scene
again
i
tried
to
call
you
you
didnt
need
to
come
today
oh
great
id
have
been
perfect
for
this
part
you
made
a
bad
decision
and
ruined
your
movie
good
day
you
didnt
need
to
come
because
the
director
saw
your
tape
and
loved
it
and
scene
huh
wasnt
that
fun
we
did
a
little
improv
there
yeah
so
you
you
were
saying
the
director
wants
to
meet
you
tomorrow
wow
sure
thats
great
your
agent
said
youre
okay
with
nudity
yeah
sure
as
long
as
its
handled
tastefully
and
that
barn
is
not
too
cold
terrific
well
uh
theres
one
more
thing
uh
uh
its
important
to
the
director
that
everything
in
the
movie
is
authentic
in
your
love
scene
with
sarah
she
talks
about
how
shes
never
seen
a
naked
man
who
wasnt
jewish
so
so
what
so
uh
well
the
director
is
insisting
that
whoever
play
that
part
be
authentically
uh
anatomically
not
jewish
you
know
what
im
saying
yes
no
what
an
italian
catholic
immigrant
at
this
time
would
not
be
bar
mitzvahed
to
get
this
part
you
cant
be
no
but
you
are
yep
you
told
them
you
werent
thats
right
wow
wow
its
definitely
all
gone
theres
nothing
there
to
work
with
what
were
you
thinking
i
dont
know
i
just
want
this
part
they
say
no
matter
what
youre
asked
during
an
audition
say
yes
they
want
you
to
ride
a
horse
say
you
can
you
figure
out
how
to
do
it
later
this
is
not
like
learning
to
ride
a
horse
this
is
like
learning
to
grow
a
turtleneck
i
know
okay
tomorrow
when
i
go
meet
the
director
i
have
to
take
my
clothes
off
so
they
can
see
what
my
body
looks
like
oh
my
god
what
are
you
gonna
do
i
have
to
call
my
agent
and
tell
her
i
cant
do
the
part
unless
unless
what
this
may
sound
crazy
but
there
may
be
something
we
could
fashion
like
what
well
im
not
sure
yet
but
um
off
the
top
of
my
head
im
thinking
doublesided
tape
and
some
sort
of
luncheon
meat
ive
got
a
great
idea
for
party
favors
for
the
shower
we
get
mahogany
boxes
and
carve
everyones
names
in
them
then
inside
is
each
persons
individual
birthstone

care
of
that
okay
