started
going
off
in
my
head
run
for
your

get
out
of
the

ugh
men
are
unbelievable
what
is
it
with
you
people
the
minute
you

thats
why
i
dont

im
afraid

afraid
of
the
commitment
thing
i
wanna
go
through
the
tunnel
to
the
other
side
where
theres
no
fear
of
commitment
ah
do
we
have
any
do
we
have
any
thoughts
here
ive
never

and
all
of
a
sudden
youre
talking
about
moving
in
together
and
i
wasnt
even
that
hungry
you
know
what
its
getting
really
late
and
i
should
just
um
dont
go
ive
scared
you
ive
said
too
much
im
hopeless
and
awkward
and
desperate
for
love
hey
janice

me
uh
ahem
i
wanted
to
apologize
in
advance
for
having
chased
you
down
the
street
byebye
here
you
go
honey
this
will
help
so
i
catch
up
to
her
and
she
says
this
relationships
going
too
fast
and
we
have
to
slow
down
ugh
ugh
that
is
never
good
then
i
got
all
needy
and
clingy
now
wait
a
minute
maybe
its
not
so
bad
how
did
you
leave
it
she
said
shed
call
me
oh
god
ugh
welcome
to
our
side
of
the
tunnel
this
ice
cream
tastes
like
crap
by
the
way
yeah
well
its
that
lowcal
nondairy
soymilk
junk
we
save
the
real
stuff
for
the
truly
terminal
cases
when
you
start
getting
screwed
over
all
the
time
you
gotta
switch
to
lowfat
yeah
you
do
so
you
dont
think
im
terminal
oh

not
at
all
youre
not
terminal
we
just
need
some
damage
control
okay
okay
so
should
i
call
her

its
a
critical
time
if
you
feel
yourself
reaching
for
that
phone
you
go
shopping
you
get
your
butt
in
a
bubble
bath
if
you
want
her
back
you
have
got
to
start
acting
aloof
she
has
to
know
youre
not
needy
so
what
you
have
to
do
is
you
have
to
accidentally
run
into
her
on
purpose
and
then
act
aloof
so
im
not
gonna
lose
her
