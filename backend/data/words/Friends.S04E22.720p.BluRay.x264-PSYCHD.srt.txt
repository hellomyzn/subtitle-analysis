hi
phoebe
ahem
i

apologize

a
tad
edgy
yesterday
at
my
shower
you
know
its
just
the
hormones
you
know
no
we
hormones
yeah
hormones
anyway
i
just
wanted
to
say
thank
you
it
was
just
it
was
so
sweet
oh
okay
so
sweet
yeah
wow
you
seem
to
be
doing
much
better
thats
great
how
are
things
going
good
no
but
okay
it
feels
like
everythings
been
about
me
lately
so
whats
happening
with
you
oh
well
actually
we
were
just
talking
about
me
not
going
to
ross
wedding
oh
it
just
might
be
too
hard
given
the
history
and
all
that
wow
this
reminds
me
of
the
time
when
i
was
um
living
on
the
street
and
this
guy
offered
to
buy
me
food
if
i
slept
with
him
well
how
is
this
like
that
well
lets
see
its
not
really
like
that
because
you
see
that
was
an
actual
problem
and
uh
yours
is
just
like
a
bunch
of
highschool
crap
that
nobody
really
gives
yeah
well
im
sorry
i
just
thought
all
right
here
come
the
waterworks
oh
i
dont
know
what
im
gonna
do
i
called
the
company
that
sent
her
and
they
dont
care
and
i
called
and
they
yelled
at
me
if
this
isnt
an
emergency
then
what
is
hey
guys
hey
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
for
last
night
what
a
great
party
and
the
guys
from
work
had
a
blast
you
know
one
of
them
had
never
been
to
a
bachelor
party
before
yeah
and
another
one
had
never
been
to
a
party
before
so
so
uh
hey
that
wedding
ring
huh
man
that
is
nice
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
i
was
thinking
i
might
pick
one
of
those
babies
up
for
myself
where
might
one
get
one
of
those
that
ring
when
my
grandmother
first
came
to
this
country
that
ring
and
the
clothes
on
her
back
were
all
she
had
with
her
so
you
might
say
that
the
ring
is
irreplaceable
oh
absolutely
its
been
in
my
family
for
generations
and
every
bride
whos
worn
it
has
lived
a
long
and
happy
life
so
you
might
say
its
a
magic
ring
yeah
the
stripper
stole
it
my
ring
my
wedding
ring
the
stripper
stole
my
wedding
ring
how
how
could
this
happen
well
i
think
it
all
started
when
you
said
hey
joey
why
dont
you
be
my
best
man
all
right
all
right
fine
im
gonna
call
the
cops
dude
i
screwed
up
you
dont
have
to
turn
me
in
not
on
you
on
the
stripper
oh
yeah
well
i
already
did
that
they
said
theyre
gonna
look
into
it
right
after
they
solve
all
the
murders
okay
well
call
the
company
that
sent
her
i
did
that
too
they
wouldnt
give
me
her
name
or
number
they
said
if
i
bother
them
again
theyd
call
the
police
i
said
you
talk
to
the
police

them
