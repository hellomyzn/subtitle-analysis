i
because
as

fat
single
and
ready
to
mingle
i
was
uplifted

milliondollar
prize
go
charlie

my
point
is
okay
so
she
dated
them

she
also
broke
up
with
them
maybe
shes
looking
to
you
know
slum
it
with
some
average
joe
phd
yeah
maybe
and
i
do
have
my
whole
career
in
front
of

nobel
prize

the
last
two
papers
ive
written
were
widely
discredited
youre
so
much
more
than
just
brains

are
sweet
and
kind
and
funny
and
sexy

give
her
a
chance
to
see
all
that
