support
your
wife
by
playing
the
piano
isnt
that
kind
of
unstable
no

so
than
acting
strike

youre

she
probably
will
support
me
hey
unless
we
move
in
with
you
dad
strike
three
you
only
get
one
more
mike
so
what

one
of
the
groomsmen
fell
out
oh

yeah
my
friend
joey
and
i
decided

up
with
my
friend
mary
ellen
who
couldnt
be

because
its
not
its

that
he
was
fixing
me
up
with
his
friend
mike
only
he
didnt
have
a
friend
mike
so
he
just
brought
my
mike

got
good
i
wanna
take
a
moment
to
mention
my
mother

couldnt
be
here
oh
god
and
and
moments
over
so
okay
oh
no
forget
that
i
can
forget
that
oh
this
is
funny
oh
but
you
need
to
know
that
to
get
that
so
oh
well
okay
i
okay
okay
monica
i
cant
do
it
like
this
this
is
my
wedding

i
just
wanted
a

wedding
where
my
fianc√©
can
go

any
time
he

to
move
a
couple
things
in
the
fridge

fat
exchange
student
