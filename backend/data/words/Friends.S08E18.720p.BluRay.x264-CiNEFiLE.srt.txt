the
best
door
in
the

hit
you
in
the
ass
on
your
way
out
isnt
this
the
most
incredible
fight
youve
ever
had
in
your
entire
life
we
couldve
gone
from
the
ceremony
to
the
reception
with
you
in
the
sidecar
ross
it
just
wouldnt
have
been
feasible
but
having
a
dove
place
the
ring
on
your
finger
wouldve
been
no
problem
it
was
really
fun
being
married
to
you
tonight
yeah
and
it
was
the
easiest
bucks
i
ever
made
okay
ross
can
i
um
ask
you
something
yeah
that
proposal
at
the
planetarium
i
know
i
know
it
was
stupid
are
you
kidding
with
the
lilies
and
the
song
and
the
stars
it
was
really
wonderful
did
you
just
make
that
up
uh
no
actually
i
thought
about
it
when
we
were
going
out
thats
how
i
imagined
i
uh
would
ask
you
to
marry
me
wow
well
that
wouldve
been
uh
very
hard
to
say
no
to
well
its
a
good
thing
i
didnt
do
it
because
it
sounds
like
it
would
have
been
a
very
expensive
wedding
okay
good
night
good
night
uh
even
if
the
sidecar
had
a
windscreen
so
your
hair
wouldnt
get
messed
up
i
will
think
about
it
thats
all
im
asking
okay
thats
it
i
give
up
at
mom
and
dads
anniversary
youre
the
one
giving
the
speech
you
know
i
dont
understand
why
they
didnt
cry

was
a
beautiful
speech
oh
come
on
hey
that
stuff
you
said
about
true
love
you
were
right
i
mean
we
did
learn
a
lot
from
mom
and
dad
and
that
picture
of
chichi
with
her
mischievous
grin
and
what
you
said
about
nana

really
wouldve
wanted
to
be
there
