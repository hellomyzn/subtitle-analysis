be
exciting
for
you
being
in
a
real
play
hmm
hey
ive
done
plays
before
im
a
serious
actor
that
infomercial
for
the
milkcartonspout
thing
youre
the
guy
who
doesnt

how
to
pour
milk
see
i
actually
can
pour
milk
but
i
got
you
believing
that
i
couldnt
ha
ha
now
see

right
at

im
gonna
tell

i
think
id

im
standing
there
with
this
charming
cute
guy
whos
asking
me
to
go
out
with
him
which
im
allowed

do
and
i
felt
guilty
you
know
like
id
be
cheating
on
ross
or
something
wow

that
means
that
youre
not
over
ross
yet
and
you
have
