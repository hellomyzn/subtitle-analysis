theyre

this
little
guy
even
crawled
up
in
my
lap
come
on
chandler
wouldnt
mind
if
i
opened
just
one
present
what
do
you
think
it
is
a
mirror
that
when
you
look
into
it
you
see
yourself
as
an
old
woman
a
tiny
salt
shaker
oh
my
god
for
tiny
salt
oh
wow
okay
that
was
fun
oh
yeah
im
just

to
open
up
the
rest
of
them
okay
whoo
although
you
know
this
is
part
of
a
saltandpepper
set
so
i
guess
it
may
just
count
as
half
a
present
what
do
you
think
well
i
guess
its
okay
to
open
one
more
if
its
part
of
a
set
its
probably
this
one
or
this
one
