hi
you
guys
hey
whats
the
matter

a
massage
client

me
three
tickets
to
the
helmut
peltz
exhibit
at
the
morgan
chase
museum
now
youre
thinking

its
just
that
he
gave
me
three
tickets
and
there
are
six
of
us
ill
give
up
my
ticket
me
too
okay
thats
so
generous
and
i
think
ross
is
generous
too
great
okay
then
its
just
us
girls
great
yeah
so
what
is
the
exhibit
its
mostly
just
photographs
of
um
lesbian
love
scenes
interspersed
with
video
games
and
free
sandwiches
oh
man
hi
hi
hi
there
hey
ross
listen
chandler

you
out
of
going
to
the
lesbian
sandwich
museum
this
weekend
thanks
but
i
have
plans
uh
elizabeth
and
i
are
going
out
of
town
oh
thats
great
yeah
think
about
all
the
money
that
youre
gonna
make
why
what
well
her
father
pays
you
for
babysitting
right
uhoh
ha
ha
no
no
thats
funny
but
maybe
its
time
to
move
on
you
know
let
it
go
stop
it
besides
rachels
going
out
with
elizabeths
father
so
uh
hes
much
older
than
she
is
looks
like
im
not
the
only
one
interested
in
fossils
huh
ross
all
that
does
is
remind
us
that
you
are
interested
in
fossils
okay
okay
uh
well
rachels
gonna
need
to
yell
sweet
nothings
in
his
ear
huh
ross
oh
come
on
thats
funny
you
know
because
hes
got
like
a
hearing
aid
you
know
because
hes
all
old
one
second
okay
look
ross
just
so
you
know
since
lizzie
likes
you
so
much
i
accept
the
fact
that
youre
going
out
with
her
really
okay
thats
great
yeah
but
then
i
changed
my
mind
im
funny
like
that
so
ive
told
lizzie
and
now
im
telling
you
i
dont
want
you
seeing
my
daughter
anymore
all
right
look
i
realize
it
upsets
you
yes
it
does
but
elizabeth
and
i
are
both
adults
and
so
i
dont
think
theres
really
anything
you
can
do
about
it
ill
tell
the
university
about
your
relationship
and
have
you
fired
oh
a
man
with
a
plan
this
is
so
exciting
you

up
on
the
wall
of

i
know
it
was
so
cool
when
it
was
up
there
before
me
and
jim
belushi
would
just
be
cracking
up
about
something
then
i
get
fired
off
days
of
our
lives
and
he
takes
me
down
now
hes
just
laughing
at
me
look
at
him
that
smug
belushi
bastard
