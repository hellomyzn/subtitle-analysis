my
boss
keeps
slapping
my
butt
and
acting
like
its
no
big
deal
whatd
you
do
about

i
didnt
do
anything
i
didnt

the
guy
who
has
a
problem
with
his
boss
slapping
his
bottom
i
gotta
tell
you
i
think
its

guy
maybe
its
that
jock
thing
you
know
how
football
players
pat
each
other
after
touchdowns
you
know
i
dont
understand
guys
i
mean
i
would
never
congratulate
monica
on
a
great
stew
by
you
know
grabbing
her
boob
i
know
for
a
really
great
stew
youd
just
stick
your
head
in
between
them
can
we
please
go
eat
yeah
what
are
we
getting
anything
but
stew
so
from
now
on
dont
give
your
boss
a
chance
to
get
you
dont
turn
your
back
to
him
or
you
could
teach
him
a
lesson
you
know
what
you
do
is
rub
something
that
smells
really
bad
on
your
butt
right
then
when
he
goes
to
smack
you
his
hand
will
smell
now
what
could
you
rub
on
your
butt
that
would
smell
bad
what
if
joey
was
president

i
ask
you
something

swearing
because
i
gotta
tell
you
if
it
is
you
can
just
kiss
my
ass

more
about
the
way
that
you
occasionally
concentrate
your
enthusiasm
on
my
buttocks
oh
dont
get
me
wrong
i
appreciate
the
sentiment
its
just
that

have
a
rather
sensitive
posterior

making
all
the
other

guts
to
bring
this
up
