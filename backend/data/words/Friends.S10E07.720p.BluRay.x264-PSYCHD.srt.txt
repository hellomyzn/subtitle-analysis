hey
you
guys
hey
what
are
you
doing
figuring
out
our
wedding
plans
we
were
doing
the
same
thing
yeah
its
really
crazy
the
hall
the
dress
the
food
i
had
no
idea
how
expensive
this
stuff
was
yeah
it
is
really
pricey
i
freaked
when
i
heard
the
numbers
so
what
did
you
two
do
about
it
it
was
simple
i
came
up
with
some
costcutting
solutions
wrote
out
a
list
and
monica
told
me
to
go
to
hell
theres
no
way
around
it
just
accept
that
this
is
gonna
cost
a
lot
of
money
i
heard
that
weddings
are
like
a
billionayear
industry
yeah
and
im
responsible
for
just
like
half
of
that
but
really
it
does
seem
like
this
money
could
be
put
to
better
use
are
you
serious
yeah
now
how
would
you
feel
if
we
gave
all
the
wedding
money
to
charity
and
we
just
got
married
at
city
hall
i
think
it
would
make
me
wanna
marry
you
even
more
well
i
gotta
say
you
guys
thats
an
incredible
gesture
maybe
you
do
that
next
time
you
get
married
no
no
no
the
next
times
gonna
be
hawaii
at
sunset
but
maybe
the
time
after
that
hey
hey
whats
going
on
our
adoption
social
worker
is
coming
by
so
were
cleaning
the
apartment
we
you
know
you
dont
want
me
to
help
you
cant
have
it
both
ways
hey
is
this
the
person
who
decides
whether
or
not
you
get
a
baby
kind
of
shes
coming
to
see
where
we
live
and
it
has
to
go
perfectly
if
she
doesnt
like
us
she
can
keep
us
off
every
adoption
list
in
the
state
hey
maybe
i
should
stop
by
she
could
be
a
soapopera
fan
its
very
impressive
when
the
little
people
know
a
celebrity
little
people
celebrity
so
i
think
im
just
about
done
here
unless
you
have
any
bad
stuff
hidden
somewhere
like
porn
or
cigarettes
what
no
chandler
i
dont
and
im
offended
by
the
insinuation
so
theres
not
a
magazine
under
the
couch
or
a
pack
of
cigarettes
taped
to
the
back
of
the
toilet
tank
or
a
filthy
video
in
the
vcr
ill
admit
to
the
cigarettes
and
the
magazine
but
that
tape
is
not
mine
it
isnt
mine
i
guess
well
never
know
whose
it
is
may
i
help
you
yes
were
here
to
make
a
rather
sizable
donation
to
the
children
well
any
contribution
large
or
small
is
appreciated
well
i
think
youre
gonna
appreciate
the
crap
out
of
this
one
well
this
is
very
generous
and
we
dont
want
any
recognition
this
is
completely
anonymous
completely
anonymous
from
two
kind
strangers
mr
x
and
phoebe
buffay
we
can
put
your
names
in
our
newsletter
not
necessary
buffay

i
was
thinking
of
taking
emma
to
the
playground

i
was
thinking
of
taking
emma
to
the
museum
of
knives
and
fire
okay
look
ross
i
do
not
want
emma
going
to
the
playground

i
had
a
traumatic
swing
incident
when
i
was
little
seriously
yes
i
was
years
old
and
i
was
on
the
swing
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
my
hair
got
tangled
in
the
chain
and
to
get
me
out
my
mom
had
to
cut
a
big
chunk
of
my
hair
and
it
was
uneven
for
weeks
and
you
made
it
through
that
i
wonder
whos
gonna
play
you
in
the
movie
okay
fine
you
can
make
fun
of
me
i
do
not
want
emma
going
there
and
i
was
thinking
claire
danes
look
im
sorry
to
hear
about
your
tragedy
okay
but
the
swings
are
perfectly
safe
and
besides
emma
loves
them
you
should
come
and
youll
see
those
things
go
like
miles
an
hour
and
theres
that
moment
when
youre
at
the
top
when
you
just
dont
know
if
youre
gonna
return
back
to
earth
space

filled
with
orbiting
children

look
on
emmas
face

a
mothers

being
chased
around
a
tire
yard
by
an
escaped
mental
patient
who
in
his
own
words
wanted
to
kill
me
or
whatever
so
i
deserve
a
real
celebration

this
seems
like
a
lovely
environment
to
raise
a
child
in
you
are
welcome
to
look
under
any
of
the
furniture

look
around
let
me
make
sure
i
have
everything
i
need
up
to
here
