cant
get
the
monkey
off
your
back
then
put
it
in
your
mouth
with
monkeyshine
beer
wow
monkeyshine
beer
because
its
a
jungle
out
there
that
commercial
always
makes
me
so
sad
yeah
but
then
the
guy
opens
his
beer
and
girls
run
at
him
so
everything
works
out
okay
i
meant
because
the
monkey
in
it
reminds
me
of
marcel
i
can
see
that
because
they
both
have
those
big
brown
eyes
and
the
little
pouty
chin
and
the
fact
that
theyre
both
monkeys
i
wonder
if
i
did
the
right
thing
giving
him
away
ross

had
to
he
was
humping
everything
in
sight

im
sorry
mr
geller
but
you
know
theres
an
old
saying
sometimes
monkeys
die
its
not
a
great
saying

is
fitting
today
someone

called
me
im
sorry
look
i

here
its
just
a
gesture
zoo

the
bird

dr
drake
ramoray

can
see
joey
through
the
magical
box
