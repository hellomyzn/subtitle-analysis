wow
fortunately

a
very
pretty
face
i
still
cant
believe
this
my
uterus
is
an
inhospitable
environment
ive
always
tried
so
hard
to
be
a
good
hostess
i
cant
believe
my
sperm
have
low
motility
while
i
was
growing
up
they
sure
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
places
hi
there
hi
im
sorry
there
wasnt
better
news
from
your
tests
last
week
but
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
your
options
okay
even
though
your
chances
of
conceiving
through
natural
means
arent
great
you
never
know
so
keep
having
sex
on
a
regular
basis
oh
damn
it
dont
worry
after
a
while
youll
tune
it
out
given
your
situation
the
options
with
the
greatest
chances
for
success
would
be
surrogacy
or
insemination
using
a
sperm
donor
okay
if
you
feel
that
neither
of
those
is
right
for
you
you
could
always
adopt
is
that
a
hint
because
we
love
you
dr
connelly
but
we
dont
want
you
to
be
our
child
wow
talk
about
an
inhospitable
environment
hi
okay
you
ready
to
go
pick
up
phoebe
and
go
shopping
lets
do
it
all
right
have
a
good
time
not
gonna
find
any
clothes
in
there
hey
you
guys
hi
guess
whos
up
for
keynote
speaker
at
the
national
paleontology
conference
uh
chris
bailey
yeah
right
when
was
the
last
time
he
made
a
submission
deadline
for
an
abstract
why
are
you
laughing
just
seeing
what
itd
be
like
to
be
a
paleontologist
its
fun
yeah
youre
up
for
keynote
speaker
yeah
whos
deciding
professor
sherman
im
meeting
with
him
today
hes
a
pretty
tough
guy
to
impress
i
think
i
know
how
to
dazzle
him
oh
youre
not
gonna
to
do
a
magic
trick
are
you
pfft
no
hey
guys
i
want
to
ask
you
something
i
may
get
to
speak
at
this
paleontology
convention
if
i
do
id
love
for
you
guys
to
come
and
hear
me
i
think
i
can
safely
say
that
we
all
have
family
issues
work
andor
are
sick
its
in
barbados
but
you
come
first
im
there
well
see
you
guys
bye
see
you
hey
so
how
did
it
go
at
the
fertility
clinic
not
as
much
fun
as
last
time
apparently
you
only
get
porn
if
youre
giving
a
sperm
sample
so
uh
what
did
the
doctor
say
theres
surrogacy
but
monicas
dreamt
her
whole
life
of
carrying
a
child
and
she
just
felt
that
watching
a
surrogate
would
be
too
hard
for
her
so
youre
ruling
out
surrogacy
yeah
so
i
dont
have
to
learn
what
that
means
aside
from
adoption
the
only
other
choice
is
insemination
so
were
talking
about
sperm
donors
enough
said
im
there
for
you
man
where
is
she
upstairs
how
do
you
feel
about
all
this
i
wish
there
was
an
easier
way
for
us
to
have
a
child
but
there
isnt
one
come
on
ross
be
a
good
guy
step
up
and
do
it
what
what
no
im
not
gonna
give
them
ben
the
data
were
receiving
from
mri
scans
and
dna
testing
of
these
fossils
are
staggering
mmhm
i
mean
weve
been
accepting
leakeys
dates
as
a
given
but
if
theyre
off
by
even
a
years
or
so
then
you
can
just
throw
most
of
our
assumptions
you
know
right
in
the
trash
so
what
im
saying
is
is
that
is
that
uh
repercussions
could
be
huge
i
mean
not
just
in
paleontology
but
if
you
think
about
it
in
evolutionary
biology
uh
genetics
uh
geology
i
mean
truly
the
mind
boggles
well
thats
not
what
you
want
incentive
for
men
ill
take
some
of
that
thats
for
men
i
know
when
i
go
to
the
party
later
mike
will
know
im
over
him
because
ill
smell
like
another
guy
yeah
okay
oh
good
im
dating
a
russian
cabdriver
seriously
does
anyone
buy
this
i
smell
like
beets
i
really
like
those
jackets
with
the
shoulder
pads
in
them
where
are
those
um
on
melanie
griffith
in
working
girl
um
i
think

told
you
i
needed
someone
by
the
way
as
a
thank
you
i

really
love
to

i
are
going

the
way
she
waltzed
in
here
all
smart
and

how
i
was
trying
to
achieve
the
positronic
distillation
of
subatomic
particles
yeah
well
after
eight
years
of
research
i
discovered
that
it
cant
be
done
well
great
that
youre
back
how
are
you
good
good
life
is
good
good
well
im
seeing
someone
oh
good
for
you
yeah
shes
also
a
scientist
so
shes
very
smart
and
pretty
and
um
its
actually
because
of
you
that
were
together
i
mean
i
saw
what
you
had
with
that
mike
guy
and
i
just
said
boy
i
want
that
mike
and
i
broke
up
youre
kidding
me
because
im
not
seeing
anybody
i
just
totally
made
that
up
really
i
dont
know
why
im
sorry
i
guess
i
just
didnt
want
to
lose
face
i
understand
yeah
okay
so
then
okay
so
were
both
living
in
new
york
not
seeing
anyone
thats
so
not
like
us
yeah
i
know
well
this
is
probably
a
stupid
question
seeing
that
you
look
like
that
but
um
do
you
have
someplace
that
you
need
to
be
right
now
well

you
dont
want
to
stay
a
little
longer
no
i
should
get
home
im
kind
of
tired
are
you
always
tired
because
that
could
be
a
sign
of
clinical
depression
no
its
tiring
to
figure
out
the
age
at
which
all
my
grandparents
died
ill
see
you
tomorrow
okay
bye
i
think
we
found
our
sperm
he
does
seem
pretty
perfect
yeah
you
think
so
should
i
ask
him
no
why
not
just
because
his
greatgrandmother
was
obese
our
kids
