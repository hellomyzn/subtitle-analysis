to
you
two
thank

much
for

youre

yeah
and
i
was
worried
that
it
was
going
to
be
uncomfortable
i
know
mona
just
hear
me
out
first
of
all
i
am
so
sorry
about
my
father
yelling
at
you
but
i
heard
that
you
totally
held
your
own
youre
gonna
have
to
tell
me
how
you
did
that
focus
okay
um
okay
yes
ross
and
i
used
to
date
and
yes
we
are
gonna
have
a
baby
but
we
are
definitely
not
getting
back
together
how
can
i
be
sure
of
that
oh
because
we
drove
each
other
crazy
i
mean
he
was
possessive
he
was
jealous
he
could
never
just
let
the
little
things
go
trying
to
date
this
woman
right
but
none
of
that
compared
to
how
kind
and
gentle
and
thoughtful
he
is
you
probably
shouldnt
touch
me
you
know
i
just
dont
wanna
get
in
the
middle
of
something
so
complicated
i
get
it
but
mona
what
relationship
is
not
complicated
we
all
have
our
baggage
you
must
too
why
else
would
you
still
be
single
im
so
gonna
leave
right
now
should
i
leave
this
open
for
you
too
im
not
sure
yet
why
didnt
you
just
tell
me
about
all
this
because
whats
going
on
with
rachel
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
i
feel
about
you
well
you
still
should
have
told
me
i
know
and
i
was
going
to
but
i
thought
it
was
better
that
you
heard
it
from
rachels
father
look
i
made
a
mistake
but
its
only
because
i
really
really
like
you
really
okay
i
guess
you
can
close
the
door
now

my
purse

a
good
kisser
