our
parents

tiny
little
brain
comprehends
that

took
time
out
of
their
lives
to
fly
thousands
of
miles
to
be
here
huh
this
isnt
right
i
realize

be
disappointed
but
theyll
come
back
when
we
can
do
it
right

ask
people
to
do
that
would
you
ask
people
to
do
that

you
point
your
pants

have
no
choice

buckingham
palace
so

little
talk
with

and
was
it
your
idea
to

the
wedding
um
im
gonna
go
to
the
bathroom
wait
up
hey
hey
since
youre
the
fixit
lady
heres
a
pickle
what
do
you
do
when
the
bride
says
she
doesnt
wanna
have
the
wedding
at
all
she
said
that
yeah
why
i
dont
know
i
told
her
it
was
stupid
to
put
off
the
wedding
just
because
the
hall
was
gone
and
she
like
flipped
out
oh
my
god
youre
even
dumber
than
i
am
excuse
me
ross
how
long
have
you

planning
it
since
she
was
ever
since
the
first
time
she
took
a
pillowcase
and
hung
it
off
her
head

we
dreamed
about
the
perfect
wedding
in
the
perfect
place
with
the
perfect
fourtiered
wedding
cake
with
the
little
people
on
top
but
the
most
important
part
is
that
we
had
the
perfect
guy
who
understood
just
how
important
all
that
other
stuff
was
i
had
no
idea
that
pillowcase
thing
i
thought
