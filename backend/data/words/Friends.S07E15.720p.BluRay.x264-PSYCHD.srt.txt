a
scene
together
yesterday
im
the
guy
in
the

oh
that
was
a
real
person
i
wanted
to
say
since
im
getting
your
brain
when
you
leave
the
show
i
was
wondering
if
there
was
any
tips
im
leaving
the
show
i
dont
know
why
did
you
hear
something
who
told
you
that
oh
uh
one
of
the
writers
which
was
it
bald
or
was
it
tall
you
know
it
doesnt
matter
because
it
is
not
true
okay
whoo
eh
and
if
it
were
true
how
dare
you
come
to
me
and
ask
me
for
tips
about
a
character
ive
been
playing
for
years
miss
monroe
oh
there
you
go
okay
look
i
have
an
idea
why
dont
we
see
what
kind
of
numbers
he
has
on
his
speed
dial
and
then
from
that
we
can
tell
who
has
more
in
common
with
him
and
whoever
does
gets
the
phone
fine
all
right
all
right
first
name
on
the
speed
dial
is
mom
oh
i
lost
my
mom
to
suicide
okay
no
way
you
cant
use
that
to
get
the
cute
guy
and
the
last
muffin
did
i
use
that
already
today
im
sorry
ben
carlos
david
oh
i
win
hes
got
barneys
on
his
speed
dial
so
you
dont
know
that
its
barneys
the
store
that
could
be
his
friends
house
or
a
bar
or
who
has
barneys
the
store
on
their
speed
dial
his
new
girlfriend

that
babys
going

hi

when
we
were
in
the
coffeehouse
we
decided
i
was
gonna
keep
the
cute
guys
phone
yeah
and
i
was
gonna
keep
it
in
my
purse
so
if
it
rang
i
could
just
pick
it
up
yeah
and
then
do
you
remember
going
into
my
purse
and
stealing
the
phone
ooh
now
you
lost
me
you
stole
the
phone
no

but
while

let
me
show
you
the
features
of
my
new
ringing
handbag
mm
oh
it
does
work
phoebe
that
is
a
different
phone
oh
is
it
hello
yes
hi
is
rachel
there
yes
she
is
just
one
moment
please
its
for
me
that
is
damning
evidence
ugh
oh
my
god
i
bet
thats
him
my
digital
fairy
tales
about

its
ri
would
you

the
one
who

that
i
will
be
here
when
he
comes
over
oh
and
how
will
you
know
what
time
to
come
over
you
just
said
it
oh
joey
the
essence
of
the
character
is
rooted
in
her
confidence
so
when
jessica
enters
a
room
for
instance
she
owns
everything
and
every
person
in
that
room
you
try
it
okay
right
well
hes
not
mad
at
the
room
try
it
again
he
owns
it
he
owns
the
room
it
is
his
he
owns
owns
owns
the
room
he
owns
it
its
a
little
weird
but
its
getting
better
oh
im
gonna
miss
this
woman
so
much
i
dont
know
what
im
gonna
do
its
been
years
of
my
life
hey
hey
maybe
maybe
uh
maybe
this
is
a
good
thing
you
know
itll
give
you
a
chance
to
shake
things
up
play
different
characters
youre
so
talented
probably
shouldve
just
left
years
ago
when
the
offers
were
pouring
in
but
you
know
i
just
got
so
comfy
here
and
ugh
i
turned
down
some
amazing
work
like
what
well
lets
just
say
if
id
left
years
ago
the
landscape
of
mexican
cinema
would
be
very
different
today
wow
but
well
now
nows
a
different
time
for
me
oh
hey
come
on
dont
uh
dont
do
this
let
me
tell
you
something
okay
when
i
watch
you
do
a
scene
im
thinking
boy
she
is
a
great
actress
but
but
im
also
thinking
she
is
hot
you
think
im
hot
you
own
the
room
we
we
should
probably
get
the
oh
yeah
yeah
we
should
get
so
when
jessica
kisses
a
man
she
usually
puts
um
both
her
hands
on
the
mans
face
yeah
i
notice
that
is
that
because
shes
so
passionate
no
its
because
that
way
the
camera
only
sees
her
you
want
to
try
it
yeah
okay
that
was
good
that
was
really
good
but
i
think
that
maybe
your
hands
are
just
a
little
off
they
should
be
maybe
like
right
mm
well
i
feel
like
a
snack
do
you
want
some
shortbread
its
scottish
like
you
are
oh
no
thanks
i
dont
like
anything
from
my
scottish
heritage
what
well
its
just
that
my
entire
family
was
run
out
of
scotland
by
vikings
it
sounds
to
me
like
your
familys
ready
to
uh
rediscover
its
scottish
roots
you
cant
play
bagpipes
at
the
wedding
how
did
you
know
about
that
we
heard
you
play
all
the
way
from
your
apartment
were
you
the
ones
who
called
the
cops
thats
not
really
important
right
now
ahem
what
is
important
is
while
we
appreciate
the
gesture
we
just
dont
feel
that
bagpipes
are
appropriate
for
our
wedding
why
not
because
we
hate
them
just
give
me
a
chance
to
perform
for
you
and
then
decide
whatever
you
want
im
not
gonna
tell
you
what
song
im
gonna
play
either
