someone

its
the
worst

i
think
youll
be
very
very
happy
its
the
longest
i

spent
on
a
computer
without
looking
at
porn
i
dont
understand
some
of
the
words
a
little
too
sophisticated
for
you
it
doesnt
make
any
sense
well
of
course
it
does
its
smart
i
used
a
thesaurus
on
every
word
yep
all
right
what
was
this
sentence
originally
they
are
warm
nice
people
with
big
hearts
and
that
became
they
are
humid
prepossessing
homo
sapiens
with
fullsized
aortic
pumps
yeah
yeah
and
hey
i
really
mean
it
dude
all
right
joey
i
dont
think
we
can
use
this
why
not
well
because
you
signed
it
baby
kangaroo
tribbiani
why
dont
you
stop
worrying
about
sounding
smart
and
just
be
yourself

dont
need
a
thesaurus
just
write

here
your
fullsized
aortic
pump

of
talk

just
look
when
i
first

was
spoiled
selfcentered
and
you
guys
really
took
care
of
me
yeah
monica
made
us
well
whatever
i
really
appreciate
it
because
i
dont

it
wasnt
for
you
guys
so
i
want
to
help
amy

okay
good
morning

today
thats
why
i
hung
it
on
the
door
oh
sweetie
you
cant
pull
this
off
amy
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
that
maybe
now

be
a
good
time
for
us
to
sit
down
and
you
know
talk
about
your
future
oh
i
cant
honey
im
gonna
go
get
my
eyebrows

uh
sure
you
want
to
eat
that
im
curvy
and
i
like
it
hi
hi
i
just
had
the
worst
anniversary
ever
i
doubt
that
tell
her
about
us
last
year
oh
well
i
bought
chandler
a
watch
and
he
wrote
me
a
rap
song
seriously
word
well
mine
was
worse
than
that
well
what
happened
we
were
at
the
game
and
this
guy
proposed
to
his
girlfriend
on
the
big
screen
thing
oh
that
is
so
tacky
well
thats
what
i
said
but
it
turns
out
mike
was
planning
to
propose
to
me
that
same
way
last
night
oh
my
god
mike
was
gonna
propose
phoebe
thats
huge
do
you
want
to
marry
him
yeah
i
really
do
yes
but
after
i
dumped
on
the
way
he
was
gonna
propose
i
dont
think
hes
ever
gonna
ask
again
i
mean
i
said
no
in
barbados
and
now
this
shes
right
if
i
were
a
guy
and
did
i
just
say
if
i
were
a
guy
maybe
you
dont
need
him
to
propose
to
you
maybe
you
could
propose
to
him
oh
i
dont
know
i
dont
know
isnt
that
a
little
desperate
i
proposed
to
chandler
all
right
moving
on
i
dont
think
it
was
desperate
i
think
it
was
amazing
thank
you
well
do
you
think
i
should
propose
i
think
it
could
be
kind
of
great
absolutely
youll
love
the
feeling
theres
nothing
like
it
okay
okay
so
how
should
i
do
it
how
about
at
a
game
on
the
big
screen
huh
how
about
at
a
foot
locker
what
what
he
obviously
thinks
thats
a
nice
way
to
be
proposed
to
plus
hed
never
suspect
it
yeah
that
does
make
sense
okay
now
would
you
