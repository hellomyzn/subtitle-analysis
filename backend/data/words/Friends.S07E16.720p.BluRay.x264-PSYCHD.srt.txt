about
receiving
yes
see
joe
not
that
thats
not
great
but
one
cool
thing
about
having
a
friend

the
ceremony
is
that
it
can
be
about
us
it
can
be
more
personal
you
can
tell
stories
about

ill
talk
about

that
what
happened
to
you
yeah
i
call
that
london

maybe
you
should
say
it
is
because
london
style
sounds
nice
yeah
okay
uh
i
was
sad
that
night
because
this
guy
thought
i

chandler
was
really
sweet
and
he
consoled
me
and
we
drank
too
much
yeah
baby
i
was
a
gentleman
and
i
walked
her
to
her
hotel
room
and
said
good
night
oh
but
then
later
that
night
yeah
baby
hey
cute
pjs
really
living
it
up
here
in
london
huh

wasnt
exactly
expecting
company
after

a
really
emotional
time
