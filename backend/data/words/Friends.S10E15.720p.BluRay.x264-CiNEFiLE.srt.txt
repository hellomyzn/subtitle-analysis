magic
wishes
like
i
dont
know
i
could
talk
to
her
boss
yeah
i
met
him
at
that
christmas
party
i
mean
we
really
hit
it
off
the
guy
who
kept
calling
you
ron
i
didnt
say

the
market
i
wanna
take
a
look
at
it
but
chandler

we
close
escrow
tomorrow
seeing

not
very
bright
but
what
if
its
better
than
ours
shouldnt
we
look
what
do
you

a
baskinrobbins
anyway
hey
isnt
joeys
agent
estelle
leonard
yeah
she
died
youre
kidding

was
the
first
black
man
to
fly
solo
across
the
atlantic
oh
wait
a
minute
i
read
the
wrong
one
oh
yeah
yeah
she
was
just
an
agent
joeys
gonna
be
so
upset
i
know
he
always
wanted
to
be
the
first
black
man
to
cross
the
atlantic
we
cannot
tell
joey
about
this
hes
already
flipping
out
about
everything
thats
changing
this
will
push
him
over
the
edge
you
dont
think
we
should
tell
him
not
for
a
while
lets
just
give
him
a
few
days
to
get
used
to
everything
else
what
if
he
reads
it
in
the
paper
unless
snoopy
says
it
to
charlie
brown
i
think
were
okay
may
i
help
you
yeah
im
a
friend
of
rachel
greens
um
actually
we
met
at
the
christmas
party
about
two
years
ago
oh
right
don
close
ron
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
um
well
im
here
to
see
if
youll
give
rachel
her
job
back
ah
did
she
ask
you
to
come
here
and
do
this
no
first
i
have
to
get
you
to
agree
then
well
see
if
she
wants
to
come
back
wow
that
is
tempting
she
loved
her
job
here
lets
face
it
youre
not
gonna
find
anyone
who
did
it
as
well
as
she
did
isnt
that
true
she
is
good
huh
i
took
a
shot
there
but
im
sorry
theres
nothing
i
can
do
oh
thats
not
true
theres
nothing
i
want
to
do
i
see
thanks
very
much
mmhm
is
this
your
son
yeah
his
name
is
ross
what
nothing
its
just
that
its
close
to
ron
does
he
um
does
little
ross
like
dinosaurs
by
any
chance
yeah
theyre
all
he
talks
about
why
how
would
he
like
to
come
with
me
to
the
museum
of
natural
history
after
everyone
else
has
left
just
the
two
of
us
and
he
can
touch
anything
he
wants
i
just
heard
it
how
you
must
have
heard
it
and
thats
not
good
let
me
start
again
im
a
paleontologist
youll
be
there
with
us
and
the
touching
refers
only
to
bones
fossils
you
could
really
arrange
that
you
let
rachel
come
back
and
its
done
well
i
guess
having
rachel
back
wouldnt
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
yes
thank
you
this
is
great
thank
you
so
much
i
swear
your
kids
gonna
have
the
time
of
his
life
thats
great
i
worry
about
little
ross
hes
always
reading
collecting
rocks
and
hes
obsessed
with
dinosaurs
hell
be
fine
hey
pheebs
hey
everything
okay
im
just
mad
at
my
agent
estelle
why
theres
a
part
in
this
tv
movie
that
i
would
be
perfect
for
and
i
didnt
even
get
put
up
for
it
she
better
have
a
good
reason
im
guessing
she
does
well
i
wanna
hear
it
because
she
keeps
doing
this
no
wait
wait
wait
all
right
i
gotta
go
just
listen
promise
me
that
you
will
wait
a
minute
before
you
call
her
well
okay
why
because
a
promise
between
friends
means
never
having
to
give
a
reason
i
love
that
saying
hello
joey
its
estelle
i
was
just
gonna
call
you
thats
weird
its
a
little
coincidental
but
believable
listen
im
sure
youre
wondering
why
i
didnt
get
you
an
audition
for
that
tv
movie
yeah
actually
i
am
i
guess
i
dropped
the
ball
there
whoopsie
thats
it
you
know
it
seems
like
all
you
do
lately
is
drop
the
ball
dont
take
that
tone
with
me
who
do
you
think
you
are
alan
lemon
the
first
black
man
to
fly
solo
across
the
atlantic
no
look
all
im
saying
is
youre
my
agent
and
youre
not
getting
me
any
auditions
and
im
tired
of
it
what
are
you
saying
im
saying
that
this
isnt
working
for
me
anymore
okay
estelle
youre
fired
goodbye
man
tough
week
for
estelle
hi
hi
um
emma
left
her
stuffed
t
rex
at
my
house
you
know
she
cant
sleep
without
it
ah
well
shes
asleep
now
stop
forcing
that
thing
on
her
okay
oh
youre
not
gonna
believe
what
happened
to
me
today
ralph
lauren
called
and
gave
me
my
job
back
no
i
mean
it
was
the
weirdest
thing
they
fire
me
and
then
out
of
nowhere
they
just
hire
me
back
i
mean
that
place
must
just
be
falling
apart
without
me
so
youre
not
going
to
paris
no
im
still
going
what
well
when
the
louis
vuitton
people
found
out
that
ralph
lauren
wanted
me
back
they
offered
me
more
money
ross
isnt
that
great
yay
hi
were
buying
the
house
next
door
and
we
were
wondering
if
we
could
take
a
look
around
im
showing
it
to
someone
else
but
please
look
around
thanks
i
feel
like
were
cheating
on
our
house
if
were
gonna
cheat
shouldnt
it
be
with
a
hot
younger
house
that
does
stuff
that
our
house
wont
do
ours
is
so
much
better
this
living
room
is
smaller
the
dining
room
looks
like
a
cave
what
a
hole
so
what
do
you
think
loveit
we
already
have
one
offer
i
think
the
lady
upstairs
is
gonna
make
another
one
they
could
be
our
neighbors
what
are
they
like
the
woman
upstairs
is
nice
she
and
her
husband
have
two
kids
uh
hes
on
wall
street
and
shes
a
oh
my
god
sure
hey
joey
you
wanna
come
with
me
to
are
you
okay
yeah
i
just
feel
bad
about
firing
estelle
this
has
gotta
be
killing
her
no
that
wouldnt
kill
her
a
coronary
embolism
might
i
dont
know
shes
gotta
be
taking
it
hard
i
was
like
her
only
client
except
for
this
guy
who
eats
paper
and
im
guessing
he
eats
more
money
than
he
makes
look
i
know
shes
not
a
great
agent
but
she
did
stick
with
me
for
years
im
gonna
call
her
and
hire
her
again
no
no
no
dont
call
her
you
wait
for
her
to
call
you
why
because
patience
is
the
road
to
understanding
which
is
the
key
to
a
happy
heart
you
blow
me
away
all
right
so
promise
youre
gonna
wait
for
her
to
call
you
i
promise
okay
and
that
means
never
having
to
give
a
reason
what
a
small
world
and
yet
i
never
run
into
beyonc√©
you
two
know
each
other
oh
we
go
way
back
before
monica
made
an
honest
man
out
of
him
chandler
used
to
be
my
little
love
muffin
so
are
you
guys
thinking
of
getting
this
house
too
are
we
gonna
have
a
bidding
war
i
better
warn
you
im
a
toughie
dont
dont
dont
no
actually
we
are
buying
the
house
next
door
why
i
dont
know
why
oh
that
decides
it
then
i
was
on
the
fence
but
knowing
that
you
two
would
be
our
neighbors
now
we
have
to
get
it
ellen
were
gonna
talk
numbers
this
cannot
be
happening
okay
the
realtor
said
another
couple
made
an
offer
maybe
the
janices
wont
get
it
maybe
the
other
couple
will
the
only
way
that
that
is
going
to
happen
is
if
the
other
couple
are
the
hitlers
okay
okay
all
right
what
if
we
get
both
houses
we
can
turn
this
one
into
a
guesthouse
thats
a
great
idea
by
the
way
i
dont
mean
to
sound
distasteful
but
when
did
you
start
crapping
money
you
come
up
with
an
idea
all
right
weve
still
got
three
hours
till
escrow
closes
on
our
house
we
can
still
get
out
but
we
love
our
house
will
we
love
it
so
much
with
her
next
door
and
shes
gonna
be
louder
out
here
too
just
the
crickets
and
oh
my
god
okay
but
if
we
dont
get
this
house
shes
still
gonna
show
up
wherever
we
go
at
least
if
shes
here
it
eliminates
the
element
of
surprise
never
again
will
you
have
to
hear
the
three
words
that
make
your
balls
jump
back
up
inside
your
body
well
we
have
to
do
something
we
cant
have
her
living
next
door
oh
that
does
it
too
who
is
it
its
me
ron
look
i
know
rachel
turned
you
down
but
i
think
theres
a
way
you
might
be
able
to
get
her
to
come
back
this
may
surprise
you
but
rehiring
fired
employees
is
not
my
main
job
just
hear
me
out
how
would
you
feel
about
offering
her
a
raise
not
good
ron
perhaps
i
can
persuade
you
what
if
you
could
give
your
son
this
genuine
pterodactyl
egg
replica
wow
thats
pretty
cool
huh
so
do
we
have
a
deal
qkay
you
got
it
yes
yes
this
is
gonna
make
me
very
popular
oh
believe
me
the
ladies
they
love
it
i
meant
with
my
son
good
because
the
ladies
not
so
much
joey

is
ai
zebooker

guy

eats
paper
