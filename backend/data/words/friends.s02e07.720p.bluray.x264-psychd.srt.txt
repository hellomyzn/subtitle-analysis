pheebs
way
to

yay
me
ha
ha
so
how
did
it
happen
i
took
your
advice
and
asked
him
what
was
going
on
what
did
he
say
he
said
he
understands
how
sex
can
be
a
very
emotional
thing
for
a
woman
and
he
was
just
afraid
that
i
was
going
to
get
all
you
know
is
he
gonna
call
me
the
next
day
and
where
is
this
going
and
so
he
said
he
wanted
to
hold
off
until
he
was
prepared
to
be
serious
wow
yeah
so
i
said
okay
relax
please
you
know
i
mean
sex
can
be
just
about
two
people
right
there
in
the
moment
if
he
wants
to
see
me
again
he
can
call
if
not
thats
fine
too
so
after
a
lot
of
talking
heh
i
convinced
him
heh
let
me
get
this
straight
he
got
you
to
beg
to
sleep
with
him
he
got
you
to
say
he
never
has
to
call
you
again
and
he
got
you
thinking
