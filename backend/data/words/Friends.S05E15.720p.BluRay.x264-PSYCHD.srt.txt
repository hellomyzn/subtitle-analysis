some
sympathy
but
somehow
you
came
off
as
the
bad
guy
what
yeah
i
think
i
told
it
wrong
we
should
talk
about
that
because
i
dont
totally
understand
what
happened
there
oh
this
cake
is
really
good
okay
see
things
are
looking
up
already
oh
my
god
someone
cut
howards
cake
who
would
do
a
thing
like
that
okay
you
got
your
free
food
you
ruined
everyones
fun
dont
you
think
its
time
you
went
home
yeah
yeah
go
back
to
all
right
everyone
calm
down
everyone
calm
down
i
have
something
that
i
would
like
to
say
who
here
likes
ross
of
course
you
dont
like
him
he
didnt
give
you
any
money
he
raised
his
own
hand
when
i
asked
who
here
likes
ross
and
hes
wearing
two
nametags
ill
be
honest
with
you
guys
when
i
first
met
ross
i
didnt
like
him
at
all
but
then
once
i
got
to
know
him
i
saw
that
hes
really
sweet
and
caring
and
very
generous
i
mean
all
im
saying
is
dont
judge
ross
before
you
get
to
know
him
all
right
you
know
i
like
all
of
you
guys
now
but
when
i
first
met
you
you
know
kurt
i
thought
you
know
abrasive
drunk
um
lola
mindnumbingly
stupid
and
okay
you
guys
gold
digger
cradlerobbing
perv
so
i
think
you
all
know
what
i
mean
obviously
i
didnt
think
they
were
gonna
start
throwing
things
i
just
thought
if
i
kept
insulting
them
you
would
jump
in
and
defend
everyone
then
you
could
look
like
the
hero
oh
wow
yeah
see
i
did
not
get
that
wheres
monica
where
is
she
i
need
to
talk
to
her
its
urgent
is
she
here
im
monica
i
need
to
talk
to
you
its
urgent
okay
okay
ive
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
about
us
you
know
a
lot
of
uh
us
thinking
and
uh
well
i
guess
theres
only
one
way
to
do
this
wait
wait
what
are
you
doing
monica
no
no
no
dont
do
it
will
you
marry
me
oh
no
no
no
what
a
bad
idea
oh
i
cant
not
look
at
it
chandler
why
are
you
doing
this
i
dont
know
but
i
know
im
not
afraid
to
do
this
chandler
im
doing
this
because
im
sorry
do
you
um
really
think
the
best
reason
to
get
married
is
because
youre
sorry
oh
no
the
best
reason
to
get
married
is
pregnancy
sorry
is
pretty
much
fourth
behind
being
ready
and
actually
wanting
to
get
married
will
you
be
my
wife
chandler
um
i
want
you
to
take
just
a
minute
and
i
want
you
to
think
about
how
ridiculous
this
sounds
yeah
im
kind
of
wishing
everyone
wasnt
here
right
now
you
know
that
none
of
that
stuff
came
from
me
i
mean
i
never
said
that
i
wanted
to
have
babies
and
get
married
right
now
yeah
i
know
i
was
really
confused
and
then
i
talked
to
these
guys
who
two
divorces
and
joey
hey
shes
right
you
know
yeah
but
still
cheap
shot
you
know
when
i
said
that
i
want
you
to
deal
with
relationship
stuff
all
on
your
own
well
youre
not
ready
for
that
i
didnt
think
i
was
oh
my
god
what
would
you
have
done
if
i
had
said
yes
well
i
wouldve
been
happy
because
i
would
have
been
able
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
with
the
woman
i
love
or
you
would
have
seen
a
chandlershaped
hole
in
that
door
hey
ross
will
you
pass
me
that
knife
no
i
will
not
its
okay
you
dont
have
to
be
so
mean
about
it
youre
right
im
sorry
will
you
marry
me
oh
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
because
i
forgot
to
say
hello
to
you
last
week
oh
no
wait
pheebs
i
think
with
something
like
that
you
just
ask
them
to
move
in
with
you
but
im
not
sure
chandler
ha
ha
okay
how
long
is
this
gonna
go
on
well
i
think
the
length
of
teasing
is
directly
related
to
how
insane
you
were
so
a
long
time
this
is
fun
oh
hey
rach
remember
that
whole
we
were
on
a
break
thing
well
im
sorry
will
you
marry
me
thats
not
funny
