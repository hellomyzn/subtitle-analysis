i
read
about

in
maxim
well
cant
you
just
go
to
vermont
the
next

yeah
we
want
everyone

be
there
as
much
as
i
hate
to
delay
your
doing
weird
sex
stuff
to
my
little
sister
and
i
mean
you
know
you
guys
this
is
a
big
deal
i

how
can
we
have
her
first
birthday
party
without
her
aunt
and
her
uncle
all
right
well
stay
we
can
just
drive
up
after
the
party
fine
but
if
we
end
up
not
doing
this
maxim
thing
because
of
this
party
believe
me
that
is
not
why
we
wont
be
doing
that
you
know
pheebs
when
i
was
little
on
my
birthday
my
daddy
would
hide
a
present
in
every
room
of
the
house
and
then
he
would
draw
a
treasure
map
to
help
me
find
them
all
aw
i
love
family
traditions
like
that
when
ursula
and
i
were
kids
on
our
birthday
our
stepdad
would
sell
his
blood
to
buy
us
food
hey
guys
hi
i
brought
the
camera
for
emmas
video
oh
good
we
had
this
idea
to
make
a
birthday
video
for
emma
and
well
give
it
to
her
when
shes
oh
cool
wow
its
like
a
time
capsule
yeah
oh
just
think
shes
gonna
be
watching
that
video
on
a
tv
that
hasnt
even
been
invented
yet
with
friends
who
right
now
are
just
like
babies
and
theyll
be
living
in
a
floating
city
that
the
humans
built
to
escape
the
ant
people

the
hope
so

have
the
perfect
cake
for
my

the
loser
well
our
dog
never
crossed
the

rachel
oh
god
sorry
i
cant
believe
they
gave
you
a
ticket
youre
such
a
good
driver
emmas
awake
yeah
i
cant
believe
this
this
is
her
first
birthday
shes
awake
were
not
even
there
everybody
left
we
still
have
this
stupid
obscene
cake
hey
maybe
i
can
fix
that
you
know
try
to
turn
it
into
something
else
oh
dont
even
bother
weve
already
ruined
her
first
birthday
and
do
you
know
how
important
these
early
experiences
are
ross
very
according
to
the
back
cover
of
that
book
that
you
gave
me
rach
shes
not
gonna
remember
this
i
guess
oh
i
just
had
such
an
idea
of
what
this
day
would
be
like
you
know
emma
laughing
and
everybody
gathered
around
her
cake
singing
happy
birthday
and
then
we
would
all
hey
get
out
of
the
road
you
stupid
student
driver
they
have
to
learn
hey
what
this
is
not
bad
oh
my
god
look
you
made
it
into
a
bunny
how
did
you
do
that
well
i
just
made
these
two
things
cheeks
and
then
i
split
this
to
make
ears
well
i
am
very
impressed
some
can
sing
some
can
dance
i
apparently
can
turn
phallic
cakes
into
woodland
creatures
now
another
way
to
organize
your
stuffed
animals
is
by
size
im
sorry

game
for
emma

for
monica
