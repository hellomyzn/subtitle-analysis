down
so
carol
and
i
went
behind
a
couple
of
those
mechanical
dutch
children
they
fixed
the
ride
and
we
were
asked
never
to
return
to
the
magic
kingdom
ooh
rachel
i
already
went
you
did
not
go
yes
i
did
monica
tell
us
come
on
all
right
uh
the
weirdest
place
would
have
to
be
the
foot
of
the
bed
step
back
we
have
a
winner
ive
never
had
a
relationship
with
that
kind
of
passion
where
you
have
to
have
somebody
right
there
in
the
middle
of
a
theme
park
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
there
that
didnt
have
a
line
well
barry
wouldnt
even
kiss
me
on
a
miniaturegolf
course
come
on
no
he
said
we
were
holding
up
the
people
behind
us
and
you
didnt
marry
him
because
do
you
think
there
are
people
that
go
through
life
never
having
that
kind
of
probably
really
ill
tell
you
something
passion
is
way
overrated
yeah
right
it
is
eventually
it
kind
of
burns
out
but
hopefully
what
youre
left
with
is
trust
and
security
and
uh
in
my
exwifes
case
lesbianism
for
all
those
people
who
miss
out
on
that
uh
passion
thing
theres
other
good
stuff
okay
but
um
i
dont
think
thatll
be
