chandler
little
baby
girl
chandler

i
heard
that
before
oh

coach
rubin
you

what
pheebs
when
youre

weve
got
a
kind
of
situation
over
here
too
uhuh
no
we
are
all
responsible
for
our
own
babies
see
thats
where
i
think
youre
wrong
weve
been
playing
them
mantoman
we
should
really
be
playing
a
zone
defense
what
do
you
mean
i
just
think
things
will
go
smoother
if
we
each
have
our
own
zone
you
know
phoebe
you
can
be
in
charge
of
wiping
and
mon
you
can
be
in
charge
of
diapering
and
i
can
be
in
charge
of
looking
at
how
cute
they
are
when
they
put
their
hands
that
sounds
really
great
but
you
should
be
in
charge
of
wiping
okay
im
a
rookie
i
should
not
be
in
the
end
zone
wow
this
is
so
great
this
is
exactly
how
we
set
the
plates
at
the
restaurant
yeah
well
this
is
not
what
i
ordered
hey
guys
hey
hey

having
the
best
morning
that
uh
porsche
ive
got
the
keys
to
still
there
shocking
since

see
the
treatment
i
get
when
im
with
that
car
people
are
friendly
they
wanna
talk
and
not
just
about
the

me
on
my
equity
investments
what
equity
investments
the
ones
that

figure
ill

i
i
dont

why
i
was
so
nervous
about
this
and
i
dont
know
why
frank
and
alice
are
always
complaining
this
is
easy
yeah
two
hours
a
lifetime
thats
the
same
check
it
out
check
it
out
when
the
babies
wake
up
they
can
meet
krog
what
are
you
doing
that
thing
could
put
someones
eye
out
he
can
do
more
than
that
he
can
destroy
the
universe
no
chandler
they
could
swallow
one
of
those
little
parts
and
also
look
at
his
smooth
area
thats
just
gonna
mess
them
up
theyre
not
gonna
swallow
anything
youre
too
overprotective
when
i
was
a
kid
my
mom
used
to
just
throw
me
into
a
pile
of
broken
glass
what
glass
sand
whatever
oh
look
at
little
leslie
stretching
in
her
sleep
oh
its
so
cute
i
wonder
what
age
it
is
when
you
stop
putting
both
legs
behind
your
head
oh
i
can
still
do
that
how
are
you
still
single
all
right
ahem
i
thought
about
it
and
maybe
youre
right
maybe
krog
is
not
a
safe
toy
good
what
made
you
change
your
mind
i
swallowed
his
sonic
blaster
gun
how
did
that
happen
well
i
was
trying
to
prove
that
i
was
right
you
know
and
it
turns
out
i
was
wrong
and
now
its
lodged
in
my
throat
damn
it
this
whole
time
we
were
concentrating
on
the
babies
and
no
one
was
watching
chandler
okay
you
two
are
asking
the
court
for
an
annulment
yes
your
honor
and
here
are
our
forms
all
filled
out
so
based
on
your
petition
you
are
seeking
an
annulment
on
the
grounds
that
mr
geller
is
mentally
unstable
fine
im
mentally
unstable
and
based
on
the
fact
that
mr
geller
is
an
intravenous
drug
user
what
uh
yes
heroin
and
crack
crack
isnt
even
an
intravenous
drug
well
you
would
know
now
it
also
says
here
that
you
lied
about
your
sexual
preference
before
marriage
oh
come
on
ross
please
i
found
the
magazines
and
finally
that
you
were
unable
to
consummate
the
marriage
well
that
makes
sense
since
youre
gay
and
addicted
to
heroin
okay
you
know
im
sorry
this
is
insane
im
not
addicted
to
heroin
im
not
gay
and
there
is
no
problem
with
my
ability
to
consummate
anything
look
ill
consummate
this
marriage
right
here
right
now
that
wont
be
necessary
and
when
we
were
dating
we
consummated
like
bunnies
now
if
you
two
were
involved
in
a
serious
relationship
that
really
creates
a
problem
your
honor
rest
assured
that
relationship
ended
two
years
ago
and
can
you
please
strike
consummated
like
bunnies
from
the
record
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
is
actually
true
uh
well
yes
we
got
married
in
vegas
and
uh
the
names
i
think
well
based
on
what
ive
heard
you
two
certainly
dont
qualify
for
an
annulment
if
you
dont
wanna
be
together
youll
have
to
file
for
divorce
thats
great
you
happy
now
look
what
you
did
with
your
funny
funny
form
what
me
what
about
you
and
your
consummated
like
bunnies
nonsense
and
what
what
are
you

is
as
stupid
as
this
one
okay
how
about
you
flew
to
london
to
stop
my
wedding
how
about
you
told
me
you
loved
me
after
i
was

those
things
because
i
was
in
love
with
you

youre
right
thats
very
different
so
lets
just
sign
the
papers
what
nothing
okay
can
we
just
sign
please
mmhm
congratulations
okay
wait
ross
wait
a
minute
um
i
uh
kind
of
have
a
little
confession
what
uh
well
you
know
this
whole
marriage
thing
kind
of
my
idea
excuse
me
remember
how
we
were
too
drunk
to
remember
anything
the
night
we
were
married
yeah
and
yeah
i
didnt
really
wanna
say
anything
but
it
just
kind
of
kept
coming
back
to
me
um
remember
we
were
in
the
casino
and
for
some
reason
you
thought
itd
be
funny
to
eat
a
lot
of
grapes
and
i
thought
it
would
be
funnier
if
we
got
married
so
ahem
as
a
compromise
we
decided
first
to
get
married
and
then
to
eat
a
lot
of
grapes
to
eat
a
lot
of
grapes
so
um
sorry
i
got
us
into
this
whole
thing
so
then
i
mean
if
you
think
about
it
this
is
all
your
fault
yeah
dont
push
it
though
i
gotta
say
i
know
i
divorce
a
lot
of
women
never
thought
id
be
divorcing
you
i
know
i
always
thought
if
you
and
i
got
married
that
would
be
the
one
that
stuck
and
it
wouldnt
be
a
secret
and
we
wouldnt
have
our
wedding
dinner
at
pizza
hut
did
i
even
treat
no
it
was
on
the
house
it
was
a
newlywed
special
that
may
be
the
most
depressing
thing
ive
heard
in
my
life
well
i
should
probably
get
these
to
my
lawyers
office
hey
thanks
ross
for
taking
care
of
all
this
ah
no
problem
yeah
im
gonna
