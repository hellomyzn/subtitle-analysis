some
creep
staring

cant
you
guys
open
your
minds
to
the
possibility
that
i
actually
like

and
might
want
something
real
look
the
truth
is
i
havent
felt
this
way
about
anyone
since

i
didnt
think
i
could

come

yeah
come
on
in
molly
hey
guys

guess
we
have
no
problem
its
like
my
favorite
fairy
tale
come
true
the
princess
the
stable
boy
and
the
lesbian
okay
okay
you
start
preparing
the
formula
and
ill
start
changing
the
box
and
then
we
gotta
put
them
straight
to
bed
when
did
we
become
one
of
those
couples
whose
lives
revolve
around
their
rats
well
you
know
what
theyre
our
responsibility
now
okay
fine
these
rats
are
our
responsibility
what
happens
when
they
mate
and
there
are
hundreds
mate
theyre
all
brothers
and
sisters
yeah
uh
not
such
a
problem
with
rats
no
theyre
more
of
a
love
the
one
youre
with
kind
of
animal
no
really
oh
my
get
off
your
sister
ew
oh
my
god
what
are
we
gonna
do
the
we
have
seven
rats
uhhuh
so
what
if
each
of
them
has
seven
rats
and
then
each
of
those
have
seven
rats
thats
like
thats
math
i
cant
even
do
what
are
we
gonna
do
well
i
know
this
is
gonna
sound
crazy
but
we
could
not
let
the
box
of
rats
ruin
our
lives
yeah
okay
i
guess
youre
right
all
right
so
we
should
just
give
them
away
but
to
nice
families
with
children
and
reducedfat
wheat
thins
those
were
bobs
favorites
its
gonna
be
okay
you
must
think
im
crazy
no
i
think
youre
sweet
good
this
is
just
so
hard
its
hard
for
me
to
let
them
go
i
guess
it
just
brings
back
memories
