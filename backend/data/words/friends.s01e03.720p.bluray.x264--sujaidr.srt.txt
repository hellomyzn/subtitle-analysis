since
always
its
like
dating
language
you
know
like
its
not
you
means
it
is
you
youre
such
a
nice
guy
means
im
gonna
be
dating
leatherwearing
alcoholics
and
complaining
about
them
to
you

think
we
should
see
other
people
means
ha
ha
i
already
am
and
everybody
knows
this
oh
yeah
cushions
the
blow
like
when
youre
a
kid
and
your
parents
put
your
dog
to
sleep
and
they
tell
you
it
went
off
to
live
on
some
farm
thats
funny
no
because
uh
our
parents
actually
did
uh
send
our
dog
off
to
live
on
a
farm
uh
ross
ha
ha
hello
the
milners
farm
in
connecticut
the
milners
they
had
this
unbelievable
farm
they
had
horses
and
rabbits
that
he
could
chase
and
it
was
oh
my
god
chichi
chandler
so
how
does
it
feel
knowing
youre
about
to
die
warden
in
five
minutes
my
pain
will
be
over
but
youll
have
to
live
with
the
knowledge
that
you
sent
an
honest
man
to
die
hey
that
was
really
good
yeah
yeah
thanks
lets
keep
going
okay
so
what
do
you
want
from
me
dimon
huh
i
just
wanna
go
back
to
my
cell
because
in
my
cell
i
can
smoke
smoke
away

i
think
this
is
probably
why
dimon
smokes
in
his
cell
alone

relax
your
hand
let
your
wrist
go
not
so
much

you
want
to
get
this
