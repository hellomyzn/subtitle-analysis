ugly
naked
gal
joey
i
gotta
see
this
all
aw
all
right
ugly
naked
guy
ooh
ugly
naked
dancing
its
nice
that
he
has
someone
shall
i
carve
by
all
means
chandler
all
right
okay
who
wants
light
cheese
and
who
wants
dark
cheese
i
dont
even
wanna
know
about
the
dark
cheese
does
anybody
wanna
split
this
with
me
ooh
i
will
mm
you
guys
have
to
make
a
wish
make
a
wish
come
on
you
know
thanksgiving
ooh
you
got
the
bigger
half
what
did
you
wish
for
the
bigger
half
all
right
id
like
to
propose
a
toast
a
little
toast
here
ding
ding
ding
all
mm
this
isnt
exactly
the
kind
of
thanksgiving
you
planned
but
for
me
this
has
been
really
great
you
know
i
think
because
it
didnt
involve
divorce
or
projectile
vomiting
i
was
just
thinking
if
youd
gone
to
vail
or
if
you
guys
had
been
with
your
family
or
if
you
didnt
have
syphilis
and
stuff
we
wouldnt
be
all
together
you
know
so
i
guess
what
im
trying
to
say
is
that
im
very
thankful
that
all
of
your
thanksgivings
sucked
rachel
joey
thats
so
sweet
rachel
thank
you
ross
mm
and
hey
heres
to
a
lousy
christmas
and
a
crappy
new
year
