i
thought
itd
be
a
good
idea
to

stuff
in
person
i
dont
think
its
a
good
idea
why
not
youd
be
giving
up
a
baby
and
i
really
dont
i
dont
know
if
anything
i
say
would
make
you
understand
the
pain
of
giving
up
a
baby
so
no
no
i
understand
the
pain
dont
hurt
the
puppy
no
no
the
puppy
is
yours
i
get
a
puppy

for
only
three
days
why
i
realize
i

start
getting
parenty

not
the
puppy

that
told
me
how
terrible
it
is
itd
be
something
youd
regret
every
day
for
the
rest
of
your
life
so
however
hard
it
is
for
you
to
give
up
this
puppy
itd
be
a
million
