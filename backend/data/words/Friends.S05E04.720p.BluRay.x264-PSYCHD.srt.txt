nice
when
i
was
a

wrote
back
a
lot
of
those
muppets
dont

by
that
time
i
was
living

you
feel
good
so
that
makes
it
selfish
look
theres
no
unselfish
good
deeds
sorry

totally
good
deeds
that
are
selfless
may
i
ask
for
one
example

this
new
secret
waiter
man
hes
really
shy
i
dont

dont
think
hes
up
to

guy
whos
the
best
sex
she
ever
had
really
thats
what
you

that
i
might
have
said
that
why

that
funny
because
im
very
happy
for
him
and
you
you
lucky
dog
hi
hey
well
emilys
willing
to
work
on
the
relationship
thats
great
yes
in
london
what
she
wants
me
to
move
to
london
but
you
live
here
you
know
that
what
are
you
gonna
do
i
bet
if
i
talked
to
carol
and
susan
i
could
convince
them
to
move
to
london
with
ben
im
sure
your
exwife
would
be
more
than
happy
to
move
to
another
country
so
you
can
patch
things
up
with
your
new
wife
it
could
happen
how
you
doing
welcome
good
to
see
you
thisll
be
your
phone
thats
great
but
im
not
really
expecting
a
lot
of
calls
no
you
answer
it
and
take
pledges
but
im
the
host
no
gary
collins
is
the
host
youll
be
answering
the
phone
you
dont
seem
to
understand
see
i
was
dr
drake
ramoray
well
heres
your
phone
doctor
i
cant
believe
i
cant
find
a
selfless
good
deed
you
know
that
really
old
guy
that
lives
next
door
to
me
i
snuck
over
there
and
raked
up
all
the
leaves
on
his
front
stoop
but
he
caught
me
and
he
forcefed
me
cider
and
cookies
then
i
felt
wonderful
that
old
jackass
maybe
joeys
right
maybe
all
good
deeds
are
selfish
i
will
find
a
selfless
good
deed
because
i
just
gave
birth
to
three
children
and
i
will
not
let
them
be
raised
in
a
world
where
joeys
right
hey
monica
can
i
ask
you
a
cooking
question
sure
if
youre
cooking
on
the
stove
does
that
mean
that
your
new
secret
boyfriend
is
better
in
bed
than
richard
chandler
is
he
i
think
im
going
to
respect
the
privacy
of
my
new
secret
boyfriend
why
if
this
guy
was
me
and
its
me
whod
learned
that
it
was
me
who
was
the
best
youd
ever
had
id
be
going
like
this
all
right
emily
as
much
as
i
love
you
im
sorry
i
cant
move
to
london
without
ben
i
understand
that
would
be
difficult
would
you
consider
moving
here
you
were
moving
here
anyway
why
cant
you
just
do
that
i
dont
know
its
just
okay
okay
but
i
know
that
even
though
ive
been
a
complete
idiot
up
till
now
you
have
to
come
here

have
to
so
we
can
work
this
out
together
all
right
all
right

now
im
the
idiot
emily

i
let
a
bee
sting
me
what
good

more
of
the
same
kind
of
programming
its
very
simple
all
you
have
to

at
that
time
tell
one
of
our
volunteers
what
type
of
programming
you

im
just
going
leave
it
entirely
up
to
the
gods
of

a
magic
ball
you
cant
make
this
decision
with

what
else
to
do
i
either
keep
my
wife
and
lose
one
of
my
best
friends
or
i
keep
my
friend
and
get
divorced
for
the
second
time

seems
like
it
works
to
me
pbs
telethon
hi
joey
hey
pheebs
id
like
to
make
a
pledge
i
would
like
to
donate
two
hundred
dollars
you
sure
after
what
sesame
street
did
to
you
im
still
mad
at
them
but
i
also
know
that
they
bring
happiness
to
lots
of
kids
whose
moms
didnt
kill
themselves
you
know
so
by
supporting
them
im
doing
a
good
thing
but
im
not
happy
about
it
so
there
a
selfless
good
deed
and
you
dont
feel
a
little
good
about
donating
the
money
no
it
sucks
i
was
saving
up
to
buy
a
hamster
a
hamster
those
things
are
like
bucks
not
the
one
i
had
my
eye
on
it
looks
like
we
have
surpassed
last
years
pledge
total
thank
you
and
the
pledge
that
did
it
was
taken
by
one
of
our
volunteers
oh
boy
and
may
i
say
one
of
our
sharpest
dressed
volunteers
mr
joseph
tribbiani

great
my
pledge
got
joey
on
tv
that
makes
me
feel
so
oh
no
look
maybe
i
got
carried
away
before
but
theres
something
you
gotta
know
if
im
the
best
its
only
because
you
made
me
the
best
keep
talking
i
was
nothing
before
you
call
the
other
girls
and
ask
which
wouldnt
take
long
but
when
im
with
you
and
were
together
oh
my
god
really
oh
my
god
now
i
understand
if
you
never
want
to
sleep
with
me
again

that
would
be
wrong
were
too
good
we
owe
it
to
sex
well
if
we
owe
it
oh
my
when

was
kind
of
hoping

just
cleaned
the
bathroom
