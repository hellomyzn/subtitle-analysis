have
you
seen
our
bank
statement
can
this
be
right
i
know
god
i
havent
seen
my
savings
take
a
hit
like
this
since
i
was
a
kid
and
they
came
up
with
double
stuf
oreos
what
happened
to
all
of
our
money
well
im
not
sure
exactly
what
they
did
but
im
inclined
to
blame
enron
well
i
guess
with
you
doing
the
internship
were
just
spending
more
than
were
bringing
in
yeah
maybe
i
should
quit
and
get
a
job
that
pays
but
youre
finally
doing
something
that
you
love
i
mean
i
cant
ask
you
to
give
that
up
although
it
would
be
nice
if
the
thing
that
you
loved
was
you
know
finding
gold
you
know
what
i
think
were
making
too
big
a
deal
out
of
this
okay
so
we
pay
our
bills
late
this
month
maybe
next
month
we
cut
back
on
a
few
things
and
maybe
we
start
eating
out
of
joeys
refrigerator
for
a
change
youre
a
chef
what
can
you
make
out
of
baking
soda
and
beer
all
right
worstcase
scenario
is
we
borrow
some
money
from
my
parents
no
were
not
borrowing
money
why
not
because
we
dont
do
that
we
are
bings
if
theres
one
thing
my
father
taught
me
it
was
well
to
always
knock
before
going
into
the
pool
house
but
the
other
thing
was
never
borrow
money

this
much
pride

i
do
i
am
your
man

i
thought
you

didnt
have
secrets
that
will
remain
the
official
party
line
look
monica
and
i
are
having
a
little
financial
trouble
yeah
i
know
what
what
do
you
mean
you
know
uh
i
just
figured
it
out
you
know
i
mean
youre
not
working
and
uh
the
economy
is
bad
oh
right
that
is
the
fastest
i
have
ever
thought
anyway
uh
i
need
to
borrow
some
money
oh
sure
yeah
how
much
two
thousand
dollars
yes
exactly
how
did
you
know
that
uh
well
i
know
how
much
you
used
to
make
and
i
know
how
much
your
rent
is
oh
okay
i
am
on
fire
listen
this
is
really
nice
did
you
write
a
check
to
monica
for
did
monica
borrow
money
from
you
uh
kind
of
i
cant
believe
her
did
she
tell
you
we
were
having
money
problems
no
no
no
it
wasnt
because
of
your
money
problems
it
was
for
something
for
her
what
something
personal
what
would
she
get
for
that
she
wouldnt
tell
me
about
excuse
me
boob
job
i
dont
want
her
to
get
a
boob
job
thats
crazy
well
its
not
that
crazy
okay
making
them
smaller
that
would
be
crazy
oh
hey
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
monicas
little
groomie
joke
well
i
think
the
reason
people
laughed
is
that
its
a
play
on
the
word
roomie
no
i
get
the
joke
sophisticated
as
it
was
no
the
thing
i
want
to
say
is
maybe
we
shouldve
talked
about
this
before
us
living
together
youre
not
expecting
a
proposal
right
oh
no
no
not
at
all
okay
were
just
moving
in
right
now
well
see
where
it
goes
yeah
well
thats
the
thing
for
me
its
as
far
as
it
can
ever
go
what
do
you
mean
look
phoebe
i
i
love
you
very
much
but
i
never
want
to
get
married
again
oh
wow
its
just
my
first
marriage
was
you
know
such
a
disaster
that
i
kind
of
lost
faith
in
the
whole
idea
mmhm
was
it
really
that
bad
at
one
point
near
the
end
she
deliberately
defecated
on
my
okay
well
thats
bad
yeah
but
dont
you
think
it
might
be
different
with
someone
else
perhaps
a
blond
who
always
uses
the
toilet
except
for
once
in
the
ocean
look
its
not
about
who
i
would
marry
i
was
certain
the
first
time
i
got
married
it
would
last
forever
i
was
wrong
but
it
just
look
phoebe
its
not
about
you
i
just
never
want
to
get
married
again
ah
im
sorry

you
okay

that
if
not
maybe
us
moving
in
together

the
best
idea

definitely
dont
want
to
get
married
no

just
wanted
to
make

the
other
day
in

awfully
boxy

be
so
bored
with

up
four
flights
of
stairs
maneuvered
a
narrow
hallway
dodged
a
rabid
pit
bull
but
these
last
three
feet
are
where
it
gets
really
tricky
you
know
sometimes
your
words
they
hurt
hey
where
do
you
guys
want
this
yeah
seriously
because
this
is
really
heavy
i
mean
not
for
me
because
im
only
pretending
to
hold
it
but
for
these
guys
just
one
last
time
on
the
marriage
thing
theres
no
wiggle
room
none
at
all
no
but
you
dont
want
to
get
married
either
right
right
except
that
i
do
want
to
get
married
couldnt
have
had
this
conversation
down
at
the
truck
huh
what
you
want
to
get
married
someday
and
hernia
i
havent
had
a
normal
life
and
i
never
felt
like
i
was
missing
out
on
anything
but
it
feels
like
now
its
my
turn
to
have
some
of
the
regular
stuff
if
you
wanted
to
get
married
why
didnt
you
say
something
before
because
i
didnt
know
how
