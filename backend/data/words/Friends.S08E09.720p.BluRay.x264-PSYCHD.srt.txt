phoebe

still
on
a
diet
chandler
doesnt
eat
thanksgiving
food
and
rachels
having
her
aversion
to
poultry
she
is
yeah
remember
i
had
to
leave
the
other
day
when
you
had
that
chicken
i
thought
that
was
just
because
i
put
the
whole
thing
on
my
hand
and
made
it
walk
across
the
table
it
just
doesnt
seem
worth
it
to
make
a
whole
turkey
for
three
people
its
a
lot
of
work
but
you
gotta
have
turkey
on
thanksgiving
i
mean
thanksgiving
with
no
turkey
is
like
fourth
of
july
with
no
apple
pie
or
friday
with
no
two
pizzas
all
right
fine
if
it
means
that
much
to
you
but
theres
gonna
be
a
ton
left
over
no
there
wont
i
promise
i
will
finish
that
turkey
all
right
youre
telling

i
just
wanna
say
that
im
real
sorry
for
whatever
i
did
to
you
in
high
school
oh
it
wasnt
just
me
we
had
a
club
you
had
a
club
thats
right
the
i
hate
rachel
green
club
oh
my
god
so
what
you
all
just
joined
together
to
hate
me
who
else
was
in
this
club
me
and
ross
no
need
to
point
she
knows
who
ross
is
so
you
were
in
an
i
hate
rachel
club
yes
he
was
no
no
so
who
else
was
in
this
club
uh
actually
there
was
also
that
exchange
student
from
thailand
but
i
dont
think
he
knew
what
it
was
so
ross
we
went
out
for
two
years
and
you
never
told
me
you
were
in
an
i
hate
rachel
club
you
went
out
with
her
we
had
a
pact
it
was
in
high
school
its
not
like
it
was
binding
forever
then
why
did
it
have
the
word
eternity
in
it
okay
monica
did
you
know
about
this
i
swear
i
didnt
hey
is
that
why
you
guys
used
to
go
up
to
your
bedroom
and
lock
the
door
yeah
huh
a
little
relieved
i
gotta
say
look
rach
im
sorry
okay
i
was
a
stupid
kid
okay
the
only
reason
i
joined
cofounded
cofounded
cofounded
the
club
was
that
i
was
insanely
in
love
with
you
obviously
i
didnt
handle
it
very
well
but
if
you
think
about
it
the
i
hate
rachel
club
was
really
the
i
love
rachel
club
uh
except
that
it
was
really
the
i
hate
rachel
club
okay
so
what
you
guys
would
just
get
together
and
say
mean
things
about
me
well
we
did
a
little
more
than
that
no
no
no
no
no
no
heh
what
what
else
did
you
do
we
started
a
rumor
what
rumor
oh
come
on
will
just
take
off
your
shirt
and
tell
us
ross
ugh
it
was
no
big
deal
uh
we
we
said
that
the
rumor
was
that
um
you
had
both
male
and
female
reproductive
parts
ha
what
thats
right
we
said
your
parents
flipped
a
coin
decided
to
raise
you
as
a
girl
but
you
still
had
a
hint
of
a
penis
oh
my
god
you
started
that
what
you
heard
that
everyone
at
our
school
heard
it
everybody
at
my
school
heard
it
you
were
the
hermaphrodite
cheerleader
oh
no
oh
my
god
this
is
all
making
so
much
sense
to
me
now
this
is
why
adam
carter
wouldnt
go
out
with
me
this
is
why
billy
tratt
would
just
stay
in
this
region
actually
billy
tratt
is
gay
now
so
that
ones
not
really
our
fault
monica

come
you
never
told
me

i
was
afraid
that
you
were
gonna
cry
and
then
show
it
to
me
joey
stop
staring
theres
nothing
there
its
not
true
im

the
process
having
spent
