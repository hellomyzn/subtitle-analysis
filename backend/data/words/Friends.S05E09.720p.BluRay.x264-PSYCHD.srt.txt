that
on
the
street
really
what
would
you
say
pheebs
stuff
like
uh
keep
your
mitts
off
my
grub
do
you
picture

from
your
stuff
whoa
phoebe
you
are
a
badass
someday
ill
tell
you
how
i
stabbed
the
cop
phoebe
he
stabbed
me
first
the
brontÃ«
sisters
were
remarkable
women
for
their
time
they
lived
in
a
patriarchal
society
sorry
im
late
but
i
left
late
ahem
okay
so
what
is
the
book
about
didnt
you
read
it
in
high
school
i
started
it
but
then
there
was
this
pep
rally
and
i
was
on
top
of
the
pyramid
but
anyway
um
whats
the
book
about
its
a
tragic
love
story
between
cathy
and
heathcliff
it
takes
place
on
these
creepy
moors
in
england
which
i
think
represent
the
wildness
of
heathcliffs
character
i
totally
get
symbolism
how
would
you
characterize
the
theme
of
this
book
uh
lets
see
rachel
green
ahem
um
i
would
have
to
say
that
its
a
tragic
love
story
thats
sort
of
a
given
but
yes
anyone
else
oh
oh
oh
symbolism
and
the
wildness
of
the
moors
which
i
think
is
mirrored
in
the
wildness
of
uh
heathcliffs
character
excellent
what
rachel
has
shrewdly
observed
here
you
completely
stole
my
answer
honey
that
was
pretty
obvious
how
would
you
know
you
didnt
read
it
what
do
you
think
uh
you
in
the
blue
shirt
i
think
that
um
yours
is
a
question
with
many
possible
answers
would
you
care
to
venture
one
are
you
just
repeating
me
all
right
lets
move
on
okay
then
why
didnt
you
say
you
hadnt
read
the
book
i
didnt
want
him
to
think
i
was
stupid
that
was
really
embarrassing
what
happened
to
you
phoebe
phoebe

your
note

only
did
no

a
cyborg

jane
eyre
was
uh
how
the

was
so
ahead
of
its
time
if
youre
talking
about
feminism
i
think
youre
right
well
feminism
yes
but
also
the
robots

psychiatrist
at

of
my
rage

if
i
may
say
right
now
is
out
of
control
he
gave
me
a
pill
for
it
a
pill
uhhuh
when
the
psychiatrist
told
me
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
because
i
yelled
at
my
boss
i
started
to
get
worked
up
again

he
offered
me
a
tranquilizer

a
good
idea

took
it

making
you
take
time
off
