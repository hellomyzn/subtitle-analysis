what
were
you
thinking
i
didnt
know
it
was
an
auction
i
figured
id
take
a
guess
help
a
charity
free
boat
why
would
a
charity
give
away
a
free
boat
i
dont
know
charity
oh
well
just
buy
the
damn
boat
phoebe
dont
you
think
youve
had
enough
to
drink
im
just
helping
the
kids
how
is
you
drinking
helping
the
kids
because
the
more
i
drink
the
less
there
is
for
the
kids
to
drink
mr
tribbiani
your
contribution
brings
us
a
big
step
closer
to
building
the
youth
center
just
out
of
curiosity
how
much
is
that
boat
worth
i
think
it
was
valued
at
hey
i
was
pretty
close
uh
so
bad
news
um
i
cant
buy
the
boat
i
dont
have
any
money
joey
joey
good
one
good
very
good
so
uh
i
think
im
gonna
take
off
now
you
cant
leave
joey
you
agreed
to
buy
that
boat
it
is
a
contract
plus
if
you
leave
my
boss
is
gonna
kill
me
well
what
am
i
gonna
do
rach
i
dont
have
that
kind
of
money
i
know
okay
okay
okay
okay
this
is
what
well
do
well
go
to
the
next
highest
bidder
and
well
let
them
buy
it
then
youre
just
gonna
pay
the
difference
okay
i
dont
know
why
the
kids
need
a
youth
center
anyway
they
should
just
watch
tv
after
school
like
i
did
and
i
turned
out
fine
not
great
so
were
hiding
in
the
bathroom
then
i
sneak
out
but
before
monica
can
her
parents
come
in
i
hid
in
the
shower
next
thing
you
know
theyre
going
at
it
on
the
floor
oh
my
god
i
got
a
good
one
i
once
walked
in
on
both
my
parents
making
love
to
the
same
guy
its
so
great
seeing
you
guys
again
id
like
to
make
a
toast
uh
as
a
poet
once
said
in
the
sweetness
of
friendship
let
there
be
laughter
and
sharing
of
pleasures
for
in
the
dew
of
little
things
the
heart
finds
its
morning
and
is
refreshed
aw
what
oh
my
god
you
guys
before
you
say
anything
have
we
got
a
story
for
you
guess
who
we
bumped
into
who
richard
oh
oh
i
thought
you
were
going
out
with
elizabeth
i
was
uh
she
was
a
little
busy
with
a
water
balloon
fight
sometimes
grownups
have
commitments
they
cant
get
out
of
maybe
she
is
too
young
for
me
when
i
was
over
there
i
felt
like
i
was
a
babysitter
i
finally
see
what
you
were
talking
about
i
dont
know
what
to
do
just
weigh
the
good
stuff
about
the
relationship
against
the
bad
thats
what
i
did
when
i
first
started
weighing
stuff
okay
um
bad
stuff
im
years
older
than
she
is
if
school
finds
out
youre
fired
shes
leaving
for
three
months
for
camp
okay
good
stuff
um
well
shes
sweet
and
pretty
and
the
only
question
you
need
to
ask
is
do
you
see
a
future
do
you
see
yourself
marrying
her
my
god
you
did
it
already
you
married
her
didnt
you
no
i
didnt
do
that
its
just
honestly
no

your
answer

gotta
talk
to
her

solidify
the
commitment
to
declare
your
love
for
one
another
to
the
world
