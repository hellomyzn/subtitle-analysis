what
you
guys
dont
understand
is
for
us
kissing
is
as
important
as
any
part
of
it
yeah
right
you
serious
oh
yeah
everything
you
need
to
know
is
in
that
first
kiss
absolutely
yeah
i
think
for
us
kissing
is
pretty
much
like
an
opening
act
i
mean
its
like
the
standup
comedian
you
have
to
sit
through
before
pink
floyd
comes
out
yeah
and
its
not
that
we
dont
like
the
comedian
its
just
that
thats
not
why
we
bought
the
ticket
see
the
problem
is
though
after
the
concerts
over
no
matter
how
great
the
show
was
you
girls
are
always
looking
for
the
comedian
again
i
mean
were
in
the
car
were
fighting
traffic
basically
just
trying
to
stay
awake
yeah
well
word
of
advice
bring
back
the
comedian
otherwise
youre
gonna
find
yourself
sitting
at
home
listening
to
that
album
alone
are
we
still
talking
about
sex
ross
no
its
good
it
is
good

just
that
doesnt
she
seem
a
little
angry
well
she
has
issues
does
she
hes
out
banging
other
women
over
the
head
with
a
club
while
she
sits
at
home
trying
to
get
the
mastodon
smell
out
of
the
carpet
marsha
see

cave
people

unbelievably
selfish

a
lot
of
money

she
had
the
chance
to
leave
a
man
at
the
altar
whats
that
supposed
to
mean
