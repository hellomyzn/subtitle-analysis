esther
livingston
gone
um
hi

what
you
doing
oh
just
updating
the
phone
book
um
gram
um
can
i
see
the
pictures
of
my
dad
again
oh
oh
sure
sure
uh
huh
how
come
just
you
know
to
see
him
oh
sure
here
all
right
uh
this
is
the
one
of
your
father
in
a
meadow
and
uh
helping
a
little
boy
fly
a
kite
and
here
he
is
at
a
graduation
another
graduation
is
this
really
my
father
is
it
really
your
well
of
course
it
is
i
smell
smoke
maybe
because
someones
pants
are
on
fire
well
i
in
all
the
years
weve
been
grandmother
and
granddaughter
youve
never
lied
all
right
thats
not
your
father
its
a
picture
of
a
guy
in
a
frame
oh
god
it
was
your
mothers
idea
she
didnt
want
you
to
know
your
real
father
because
it
hurt
her
so
much
when
he
left
i
didnt
wanna
go
along
with
it
but
then
she
died
and
it
was
harder
to
argue
with
her
not
impossible
but
harder
all
right
so
hes
not
a
famous
tree
surgeon
and
i
guess
he
doesnt
live
in
a
hut
in
burma
where
theres
no
phones
last
i
heard
he
was
a
pharmacist
somewhere
upstate
that
makes
no
sense
why
would
the
villagers
worship
a
pharmacist
honey
oh
yeah
yeah
anyway
thats
all
i
know
that
and
this
this
is
the
real
him
oh
i
remember
my
father
all
dressed
up
in
the
red
suit
the
big
black
boots
and
the
patent
leather
belt
sneaking
around
downstairs
he
didnt
want
us
to
see
him
but
hed
be
drunk
so
hed
crash
into
something
and
wake
everybody
up
that
doesnt
sound
like
a
very
merry
christmas
