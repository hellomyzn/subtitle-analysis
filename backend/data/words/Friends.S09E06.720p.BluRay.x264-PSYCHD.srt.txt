well
just
for
a
couple
of
days
im
here
to
explain
to
the
people
who
gave
us
our
grant
why
its
a
positive
thing
that
weve
spent
all
their
money
and
uh
accomplished
uh
nothing
who
cares
it
got
you
here
well
it
got
me
to
new
york
anyway
then
i
got
in
a
cab
at
the
airport
and
the
guy
said
where
to
i
just
gave
him
your
address
i
didnt
even
think
about
it
wow
wheres
your
luggage
damn
it
all
right
ill
call
the
cab
company
we
can
call
them
later
can
you
just
stand
there
for
a
moment
boy
theres
an
old
russian
expression
um
that
goes
roughly
translated
that
means
um
this
thing
that
im
looking
at
wow
thank
you
uh
no
you
should
see
me
when
actually
no
i
look
pretty
good
are
you
kidding
you
know
when
you
dont
see
someone
for
a
long
time
and
you
kind
of
build
them
up
in
your
head
you
start
thinking
come
on
dont
be
crazy
nobodys
that
beautiful
but
well
you
are
well
so
um
are
you
seeing
anyone
no
im
just
the
worst
person
ever
how
can
i
not
tell
david
that
im
seeing
mike
maybe
he
didnt
give
you
a
chance
he
said
are
you
seeing
someone
and
i
said
no
oh
well
that
wouldve
been
your
window
yeah
i
mean
i
dont
know
i
was
looking
in
his
eyes
and
i
was
just
thinking
oh
my
god
its
david
davids
here
hes
just
so
irresistible
really
the
scientist
guy
really
chandler
continue
okay
then
it
gets
worse
because
i
told
him
i
would
see
him
tomorrow
night
phoebe
i
know
evil
and
and
and
and
i
like
mike
so
much
you
know
its
just
going
really
well
oh
my
god
wow
isnt
it
ironic
that
david
would
show
up
on
the
same
day
that
you
and
mike
exchange
keys
uhhuh
yeah
you
know
and
given
my
lifelong
search
for
irony
you
can
imagine
how
happy
i
am
what
are
you
gonna
do
i
mean
i
guess
i
just
have
to
tell
david
that
nothing
can
happen
between
us
unless
i
dont
you
know
complicated
moral
situation
no
right
no
wrong
you
have
to
tell
david
i
knew
i
shouldve
had
this
conversation
with
joey
funniest
guy
shes
ever
met
im
funny
right
what
do
you
know
youre
a
door
you
just
like
knockknock
jokes
save
it
for
inside
hey
hey
so
oklahomas
a
crazy
place
you
know
they
call
it
the
sooner
state
frankly
id
sooner
be
in
any
other
state
and
whats
with
oklahoma
having
a
panhandle
can
all
states
have
stuff
like
that
hey
yeah
im
from
the
uh
waistband
of
wyoming
but
when
i
was
we
headed
over
to
the
crotch
was
your
cabin
pressurized
and
dont
get
me
started
on
the
way
the
people
from
tulsa
talk
okay
whats
with
the
word
yall
you
know
just
two
words
just
pushed
together
are
we
all
allowed
to
do
that
because
if
so
i
say
why
stop
there
you
know
your
new
poodle
could
be
your
noodle
and
fried
chicken
could
be
fricken
waiter
waiter
excuse
me
ill
have
the
fricken
see
thats
funny
with
the
fricken
right
no
it
just
reminds
me
of
something
this
guy
did
today
at
work
i
told
you
about
that
funny
guy
jeffrey
right
yeah
he
came
up
well
he
did
this
bit
you
probably
had
to
be
there
but
it
was
liza
minnelli
locked
in
our
freezer
eating
a
raw
chicken
oh
ha
ha
were
you
there
no
but
it
sounds
fricken
funny
i
really
understand
how
hard
its
gotta
be
to
leave
your
child
with
another
person
i
mean
its
like
leaving
behind
a
piece
of
your
heart
sandy
thats
exactly
what
it
is
are
you
gay
ross
its
okay
i
get
that
a
lot
doing
what
i
do
but
i
am
straight
im
engaged
actually
oh
her
names
delia
thats
pretty
so
youre
just
like
a
guy
whos
a
nanny
i
realize
how
its
a
bit
unorthodox
for
some
people
but
i
really
believe
the
most
satisfying
thing
you
can
do
with
your
life
is
take
care
of
a
child
okay
like
at
my
last
job
i
met
daniel
when
he
was
weeks
old
and
i
got
to
watch
him
grow
into
this
awesome
person
when
i
left
i
said
ill
see
you
soon
and
he
said
to
me
skadandy
that
was
his
name
for
me
oh
ha
ha
ill
see
you
every
day
right
in
its
okay
yeah
kids
say
all
kinds
of
crap
oh
god
she
must
need
her
diaper
changed
i
can
take
care
of
that
if
you
want
oh
that
would
be
great
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
him
oh
come
on
rach
hes
a
guy
so
what
hes
smart
hes
qualified
give
me
one
good
reason
we
shouldnt
try
him
out
because
its
weird
why
what
kind
of
a
job
is
that
for
a
man
a
nanny
i
mean
its
like
if
a
woman
wanted
to
be
yes
king
i
uh
hope
you
dont
mind
i
used
some
of
my
homemade
lotion
on
emma
its
a
mixture
of
calendula
and
honey
cream
itll
dry
that
rash
right
up
plus
it
keeps
the
hands
young
yes
sandy
youre
hired
thats
great
im
sorry
its
just
such
an
emotional
thing
when
youre
welcomed
into
a
new
family
oh
god
come
here
you
gotta
be
at
least
bi
hey
i
need
you
to
set
me
up
for
a
joke
when
monicas
around
ask
me
about
fire
trucks
ooh
i
dont
know
chandler
im
not
so
good
with
remembering
lines
well
thank
god
your
livelihood
doesnt
depend
on
it
i
know
right
why
are
we
doing
this
monica
says
that
her
maître
d
is
the
funniest
guy
shes
ever
met
seriously
she
actually
said
that
yes
am
i
crazy
to
be
this
upset
no
being
funnys
your
thing
yeah
without
that
you
just
got
lame
with
women
hi
there
you
are
fire
trucks
wow
you
look
even
more
beautiful
than
you
did
yesterday
ooh
in
fact
im
going
to
kiss
you
now
oh
wait
wait
yeah
i
cant
get
away
with
stuff
like
that
it
sounded
sexy
in
my
head
so
i
no
no
its
not
that
remember
when
you
asked
me
if
i
was
seeing
someone
and
i
said
no
well
um
i
am
his
names
mike
oh
oh
i
shouldve
told
you
no
well
yeah
yeah
im
sorry
im
sorry
well
its
okay
i
understand
well
are
you
happy
with
this
guy
i
am
happy
damn
it
im
sorry
i
dont
mean
that
i
want
you
to
be
happy
but
only
with
me
no
thats
not
fair
who
cares
leave
him
i
dont
mean
that
yes
i
do
im
sorry
um
i
think
i
should
probably
uh
go
well
but
david
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
you
know
telling
you
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
things
ive

to
do
well
just
so
you
know
hearing
it
wasnt
exactly
a
vladnik
carnival
either
can
we
at
least
hug
goodbye
of
course
yeah
you
know

a
kiss
on
the
cheek
wouldnt
be
totally
inappropriate
no
no
i
mean
in
minsk
yeah
its
um
two
on
each
cheek
mmhm

uh
one
on
the

was
a
tough
guy

was
hard
i
