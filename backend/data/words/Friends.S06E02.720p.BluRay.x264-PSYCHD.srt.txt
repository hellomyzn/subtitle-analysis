she
didnt
cry
she
wasnt
angry
or
sad
and
youre
upset
because
you
didnt
make
your
best
friend
cry
all
im
asking
for
is
a
little
emotion
is
that
too
much
to
ask
after
six
years
what
are
rachel
and
i
not
as
close
as
you
guys
i
mean
did
we
not
have
as
much
fun
dont
i
deserve
a
few
tears
when
we
told
joey
he
cried
his
eyes
out
hey
i
did
not
cry
my
eyes
out
come
on
its
like
the
end
of
an
era
no
more
jman
and
channys
okay
i
gotta
ask
who
calls
us
that
you
got
married
again
yes
so
thats
your
second
marriage
in
two
years
yes
second
in
two
years
third
overall
i
have
been
a
divorce
attorney
for
years
and
never
have
i
had
so
much
business
from
one
client
why
dont
you
tell
me
what
happened
basically
rachel
and
i
were
in
vegas
and
we
got
drunk
im
sorry
is
this
the
same
rachel
whose
name
you
said
at
the
altar
in
the
second
marriage
yes
yes
yes
heh
but
i
do
not
love
her
oh
thats
better
then
this
was
just
a
drunken
mistake
and
i
need
to
get
it
annulled
i
see
have
you
considered
therapy
i
think
just
the
annulment
for
today
there
are
some
forms
to
fill
out
easy
well
need
witnesses
who
can
testify
that
you
were
not
of
sound
mind
no
problem
heh
well
need
you
and
rachel
to
testify
before
a
judge
ooh
theres
no
way
to
do
this
without
her
because
i
kind
of
already
told
her
it
was
taken
care
of
of
course
you
did
look
you
cant
get
an
annulment
unless
you
and
rachel
are
both
there
uhhuh
what
about
someone
who
looks
like
rachel
i
will
think
about
the
therapy
hey
hey
so
um
i
was
thinking
that
maybe
we
should
start
dividing
up
our
stuff
okay
no
point
in
dragging
it
out
dragging
out
the
long
process
of
you
moving
out
and
us
not
living
together
anymore
okay
hey
rach
yeah
what
about
this
who
gets
this
i
dont
know
if
i
want
it
because
it
might
be
too
many
memories
what
is
that
i
dont
know
rachel
how
about
this
i
want
you
to
have
the
big
plate
wow
monica
thanks
i
love
this
plate
something
to
remember
me
by
mon
youre
not
dying
im
just
moving
out
were
gonna
see
each
other
all
the
time
but
still
its
a
big
change
the
end
of
an
era
you
might
say
are
you
okay
youre
not
blinking
im
fine
i
was
thinking
about
how
its
an
end
of
an
era
oh
all
right
but
i
gotta
say
i
dont
think
six
years
counts
as
an
era
an
era
is
defined
as
a
significant
period
of
time
it
was
significant
for
me
maybe
it
wasnt
significant
to
you
what
is
the
matter
with
you
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
arent
you
more
upset
arent
you
gonna
be
sad
that
were
not
living
together
arent
you
gonna
miss
me
at
all
monica
all
right
but
dont
get
mad
at
me
its
just
a
little
hard
to
believe
whats
hard
to
believe
i
mean
its
you
guys
you
do
this
kind
of
stuff
you
know
you
were
gonna
get
married
in
vegas
and
then
you
backed
out
im
not
upset
because
i
dont
see
you
going
through
with
it
im
sorry
rachel
its
going
to
happen
chandler
is
gonna
move
in
here
but
i
no
wait
just
let
me
finish
okay
this
isnt
something
that
we
just
impulsively
decided
