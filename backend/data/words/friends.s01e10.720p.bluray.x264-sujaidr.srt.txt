okay
hi

and
gentlemen
back
by
popular
demand
miss
phoebe
buffay
crowd
cheering
thanks
hi
um
ahem
i
want
to
start
with
a
song
that
means
a
lot
to
me
this
time
of
year
singing
i
made
a
man
with
eyes
of
coal
and
a
smile
so
bewitchin
how
was
i
supposed
to
know
that
my
mom
was
dead
in
the
kitchen
lalala
my
mothers
ashes
even
her
eyelashes
are
resting
in
a
little
yellow
jar
and
sometimes
when
its
freezing
david
im
being
honest
here
you
dont
agree
i
feel
a
little
sneezy
max
youre
right
and
now
i
excuse
me
excuse
me
yeah
noisy
boys
is
it
something
that
youd
like
to
share
with
the
group
no
no
thats
okay
come
on
if
its
important
enough
to
discuss
while
im
playing
then
i
assume
its
important
enough
for
everyone
else
to
hear
that
guys
going
home
with
a
note
clears
throat
nothing
i
was
just
saying
could
you
speak
up
sorry
i
was
just
saying
to
my
friend
you
were
the
most
beautiful
woman
id
ever
seen
and
you
said
daryl
hannah
darryl
hannah
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
that
hed
ever
seen
in
his
life
and
i
said
yeah
i
liked
her
in
splash
but
not
so
much
in
wall
street
i
thought
she
had
a
hard
quality
a
hard
quality
and
uh
while
daryl
hannah
is
beautiful
in
a
conventional
way
you
are
uh
luminous
with
a
kind
of
delicate
grace
then
thats
when
you
started
yelling
okay
were
gonna
take
a
short
break
i
think
that
guys
going
home
with
more
than
a
note
ross
come
here
marcel
sit
here
marcel
chattering
pheebs
i
cant
believe
he
hasnt
kissed
you
yet
i
mean
god
by
my
sixth
date
with
paolo
i
mean
he
had
already
named
both
my
breasts
ooh
did
i
just
share
too
much
just
a
smidge
davids
like
you
know
a
scientist
guy
hes
very
methodical
i
think
its
romantic
me
too
oh
did
you
ever
see
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
monica
yeah
well
hes
kind
of
like
the
guy
i
went
to
see
that
with
inaudible
dialogue
except
except
hes
smarter
and
gentler
and
sweeter
i
just
i
just
want
to
be
with
him
all
the
time
you
know
day
and
night
and
night
and
day
and
special
occasions
wait
a
minute
i
see
where
this
is
going
youre
gonna
ask
him
to
new
years
youre
gonna
break
the
pact
shes
gonna
break
the
pact
no
no
no
yeah
could
i
just
yeah
because
i
already
asked
janice
rachel
you
what
come
on
this
was
a
pact
this
was
your
pact
i
snapped
okay
i
couldnt
handle
the
pressure
and
i
snapped
yeah
but
janice
that
was
like
the
worst
breakup
in
history
im
not
saying
it
was
a
good
idea
im
saying
i
snapped
hi
hi
sorry
im
late
too
many
jokes
must
mock
joey
nice
shoes
huh
aah
youre
killing
me
ross
hes
playing
with
my
spatulas
again
look
hes
not
gonna
hurt
them
right
do
you
always
have
to
bring
him
here
look
i
didnt
want
to
leave
him
alone
all
right
we
had
our
first
fight
this
morning
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
my
working
late
i
said
some
things
that
i
didnt
mean
he
threw
some
feces
you
know
if
youre
gonna
work
late
i
can
look
in
on
him
for
you
oh
that
would
be
great
okay
but
if
you
do
make
sure
it
seems
like
youre
there
to
see
him
okay
and
youre
not
like
doing
it
as
a
favor
to
me
okay
but
if
he
asks
im
not
going
to
lie
but
you
cant
actually
test
this
theory
because
todays
particle
accelerators
are
nowhere
near
powerful
enough
to
simulate
these
conditions
okay
all
right
i
have
a
question
then
yeah
were
you
planning
on
kissing
me
ever
uh
thats
definitely
a
valid
question
and
uh
the
answer
would
be
yes
yes
i
was
but
see
i
wanted
it
to
be
this
phenomenal
kiss
that
happened
at
this
phenomenal
moment
because
well
its
you
sure
yeah
right
but
see
the
longer
i
waited
the
more
phenomenal
the
kiss
had
to
be
and
now
weve
reached
a
place
where
its
just
got
to
be
one
of
those
things
where
i
sweep
everything
off
the
table
and
throw
you
down
on
it
and
im
not
really
a
sweeping
sort
of
fella
oh
david
i
think
you
are
a
sweeping
sort
of
fella
i
mean
youre
a
sweeper
trapped
inside
a
physicists
body
really
oh
yeah
im
sure
of
it
you
should
just
do
it
just
sweep
and
throw
me
heh
now
now
right
now
just
okay
okay
okay
chuckles
you
know
what
this
is
just
really
expensive
okay
and
ill
tell
you
this
was
a
gift
so
now
youre
just
kind
of
tidying
up
okay
what
the
hell
what
the
hell
shouts
you
want
me
to
actually
throw
you

can
hop
