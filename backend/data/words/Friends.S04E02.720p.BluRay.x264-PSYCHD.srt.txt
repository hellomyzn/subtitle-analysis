i
just
have
this
really
strong
feeling
that
this
cat
is
my
mother
you
mean
the
mom
you
met
in
montauk
she
was
a
cat
no
no

feeling
okay
and
for

how
about
the
fact
that
she
went
into
my
guitar
case
which
is
lined
with
orange
felt
my
mothers
favorite
fish
was
orange
roughy
cats
like
fish
hi
mommy
oh
i
havent
seen
this
smile
in
years
dude
phoebes
moms
got
a
huge
pair
of
let
it
go
hey
um
when
were
you
gonna
tell
me
that
youre
going
out
with
chip
matthews
now
is
it
okay
if
i
go
out
with
chip
matthews
no
its
not
okay
i
cant
believe
youd
want
to
after
what
he
did
to
me
what
that
thing
at
the
prom
monica
i
couldnt
find
him
for
two
hours
he
was
having
sex
with
amy
welsh
come
on
that
was
back
in
high
school
how
could
that
still
bother
you
i
mean
why
of
all
people
do
you
have
to
go
out
with
chip
look
you
and
i
went
to
different
schools
okay
that
doesnt
help
because
we
went
to
the
same
high
school
you
went
to
one
where
you
were
popular
and
you
got
to
ride
off
on
chips
motorcycle
and
wear
his
letterman
jacket
i
went
to
one
where
i
wore
a
band
uniform
that
you
had
to
have
specially
made
they
had
to
have
that
specially
made
it
was
a
project
for
one
of
the
home
ec
classes
oh
my
god
they
told
us
that
was
for
the
mascot
back
then
i
thought
that
id
never
ever
get
the
chance
to
go
out
with
a
chip
matthews
and
now
hes
called
me
up
and
asked
me
out
and
the
fat
girl
inside
of
me
really
wants
to
go
i
owe
her
this
i
never
let
her
eat
oh
you
go
out
with
him
oh
really
yeah
if
its
possible
could
you
leave
him
somewhere
and
go
have
sex
with
another
guy
ill
try
so
you
guys
having
any
luck
getting
rid
of
the
entertainment
center
there
were
a
couple
calls
last
night
but
uh
i
dont
think
any
of
them
are
gonna
work
out
yes
joey
has
a
very
careful
screening
process
apparently
not
everyone
is
qualified
to
own
wood
and
nails
stop
it
stop
it
she
keeps
squirming
and
trying
to
get

long
is
your
mom
gonna
be

guess
until
she
you

gets
used
to
the
fact
that

think
shes
