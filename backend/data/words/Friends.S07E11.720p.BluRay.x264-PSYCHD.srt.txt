i
thought
that

it
i

from
the
ages
of
to
frannie
and
i
were
inseparable
well
maybe
since
the
age
of
frannies
made
some
new
friends
look
its
probably
just
a
mistake
let
me
call
aunt
cheryl
okay
maybe
you
are
invited
and
the
invitation
just
got
lost
in
the
mail
yeah
well

call
her

tell
her
that
you
know
when
we
were
kids
her
precious
little
frannie
tried
to
undress
me
several
times
okay

i
used
to
undress
my
cousin

that
back
hi
the
other
cheesecake

they
delivered
it
to
the
wrong
address

so
just
bring
it
back
downstairs
whats
the
problem
i
cant
seem
to
say
goodbye
are
you
serious
chandler
we
ate
an
entire
cheesecake
two
days
ago
and
you
want
more
well
ive
forgotten
what
it
tastes
like
okay
it
was
cheesecake
it
was
fine
it
had
a
buttery
crumbly
grahamcracker
crust
with
a
very
rich
yet
light
creamcheese
filling
wow
my
whole
mouth
just
filled
with
saliva
ahem
know
what
forget
it
we
are
just
hungry
we
have
not
had
lunch
we
are
just
lightheaded
so
let
us
go
out
and
have
lunch
and
forget
about
the
cheesecake
well
drop
it
off
downstairs
so
were
not
tempted
where
do
you
wanna
go
to
lunch
mamas
little
bakery
chicago
illinois
aw
mel
torm√©
died
joey
that
papers
like
a
year
old
oh
does
that
mean
the
sam
goodys
sale
is
over
hey
hey
so
i
finally
heard
back
from
aunt
cheryl
and
apparently
it
wasnt
a
mistake
uh
theres
limited
seating
in
the
hall
limited
seating
i
am
just
one
tiny
person
yeah
but
she
doesnt
know
that
i
mean
the
last
time
she
saw
you
you
wouldve
turned
one
of
those
little
wedding
chairs
into
kindling
limited
seating
thats
such
a
lame
excuse
thats
not
the
reason
why
shes
not
inviting
me
whats
the
big
deal
i
wasnt
even
invited
to
the
ceremony
just
the
reception
and
you
know
what
if
it
makes
you
feel
any
better
joan
and
i
will
just
make
an
appearance

as
a
sign
of
protest
joan
yeah
joan
tedeschi

date
shes
an
assistant
professor

the
linguistics
department

a
minute

got
ross
geller
and
guest
i
wasnt
invited
and
you
got
and
guest
uh
excuse
me
i
do
have
to
interrupt
