coming
really
good
i
should
be
ready
to
kill
myself
any
day
now
well
you
sure
found
that
quick
i
just
wish
i
didnt
feel
this
way
about
rachel
i
wish
things
could
go
back
to
normal
i
mean
i
love
living
with
her
and
helping
out
with
the
baby
is
amazing

now
i
think
ross
feels
left
out
you
know
when
i
had
to
take
rachel
to
the
hospital
the
doctor
thought
i
was
the
father
god
you
you
should
have
seen
the
look
on
ross
face
by
the
way
i
have
no
idea
what
im
doing
here
for
all
i
know
im
locking
it
more
hey
you
try
opening
it
with
a
credit
card
thats
a
good
idea
okay
yeah
so
uh
ross
is
kind
of
bummed
huh
ugh
i
ju
i
feel
terrible
its
not
your
fault
what
are
you
gonna
do
not
take
her
to
the
hospital
youre
doing
nothing
wrong
except
for
harboring
an
allconsuming
love
for
the
woman
carrying
his
baby
richard
if
youre
in
there
could
you
pass
me
my
credit
card
