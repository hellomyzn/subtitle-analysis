hey
how
are

that
my
prom
date
had
stood
me
up
so
ross
selflessly
offered
to
take
me
what
a
nice
story
heh
so
ross
was
in
college
and
decided
to
jump
at
the
chance
to
take
a
young
girl
to
her
prom
wow
i
definitely
did
not
see
that
one
backfiring
im
gonna
go
to
the
bathroom
yeah
take
your
time
just
so
you
know
i
was
a
freshman
and
she
was
a
senior
so
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
ross
look
i
know
ive
been
giving
you
a
lot
of
jabs
its
partly
because
im
very
protective
of
lizzie
and
partly
because
they
just
keep
coming
to
me
i
have
to
admit
that
after
all
the
wonderful
things
lizzie
has
told
me
and
the
many
many
many
stories
that
rachel
has
told
me
that
well
youre
not
all
bad
not
all
bad
im
sorry
i
was
so
harsh
but
you
have
to
understand
i
still
look
at
lizzie
like
shes
a
girl
you
know
i
know
what
you
mean
i
do
that
too
i
beg
your
pardon
no
i
dont
see
her
as
a
girl
i
mean
i
have
a
son

i
still
think
of
him
as
a
baby

ross

learn
something
from
each
marriage
how
to
make
the
next
one
even
shorter
oh
wait
a
minute
thats
not
fair
he
was
married
to
me
a
hell
of
a
lot
longer
than
he
was
to
emily
he
just
didnt
tell
me
maybe
i
have
to
pee
again
well
this
is
fun
so
ross
did
you
kill
any
of
these
wives
you
know
what
i
i
have
had
enough
of
this
i
care
a
great
deal
about
your
daughter
and
i
have
treated
her
with
nothing
but
respect
so
if
youve
got
a
problem
with
me
are
you
yelling
at
me
god
no
you
know
what
daddy
if
you
dont
like
ross
thats
fine
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
im
gonna
go
out
with
him
anyway
really
well
if
it
doesnt
matter
to
her
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
still
not
yelling
well
what
can
i
say
this
doesnt
make
me
like
you
better
thats
okay
im
not
so
crazy
about
myself
right
now
either
then
we
agree
yeah
i
guess
so
neither
of
us
like
ross
i
like
ross
oh

just
thought
of
another
story
about
how
nice
ross
