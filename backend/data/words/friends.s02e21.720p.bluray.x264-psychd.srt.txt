the
beast
at
the
threshold
its
just
i
have
no
family
left
except
for
my
grandmother
but
lets
face
it
shes
not
gonna
be
around
forever
despite
what
she
says
and
i
have
a
sister
who
ive
barely
spoken
to
since
we
shared
a
womb
i
dont
know
this
is
my
real
father
and
i
want
things
to
be
like
just
right
i
completely
understand
yeah
whatever
you
need
hey
you
want
to
go
home
okay
thanks
sorry
again
what
was
that
uh
im
guessing
the
thresholds
clear
now
i
want
to
buy
five
shares
of
sgj
now
come
on
time
is
money
my
friend
thank
you
whoo
time
is
money

friend
you
missed
takes
money
to
make
money
and

me
come
down
there
and
kick
your
wall
street
butt
i
made
before
breakfast
what
have
you
done
i
had
breakfast
here
so
technically
i
saved
how
did
you
make
well
my
financially
challenged
friends
i
split
my
money
and
i
bought
some
shares
of
chp
and
zxy
how
come
those
well
chp
because
i
used
to
have
a
crush
on
erik
estrada
and
zxy
because
i
think
it
sounds
zexy
ahem
what
happened
to
meg
meg
was
good
for
me
but
i
dumped
her
my
motto
is
get

go
down
that
is
so
not
my
motto
hey
hey
pheebs
oh
hey
