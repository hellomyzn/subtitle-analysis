get
hung
up
on
where

this
going
afraid
to
ask
him
could
not
be
more
terrified
i
think
you
should
seriously
consider
marriage
give
rachel
another
chance
to
dress
like
princess
bubble
yum
wheres
benny
there
he
is
wheres
benny
there
he
is
thats
probably
why
babies
learn
to
talk
so
they
can
tell
grownups
to
cut
it
out
hey
i
got
a
question
for
you
just
a
little
thing
no
pressure

i
wish
you
both
a
wonderful
life
together
aw
and
rachel
what
no
no
in
all
seriousness
not
a
lot
of
women
would
have
the
guts
to
come
back
here
and
even
fewer
whod
do
it
with
their
asses
hanging
out
thats
it
id
like
to
add
something
to
that
what
are
you
adding
what
are
you
adding
its
okay
its
okay
most
of
you
dont
know
me
im
rachels
boyfriend
oh
dear
god
ross
and
id
just
like
to
say
that
it
did
take
a
lot
of
courage
for
rachel
to
come
here
tonight
and
just
for
the
record
she
did
not
run
out
on
barry
because
she
had
syphilis
what
are
you
doing
im
serious
the
reason
she
walked
out
on
barry
is
simply
that
she
didnt
love
him
which
incidentally
worked
out
pretty
well
for
me
heh
heh
cheers
see
you
in
the
parking
lot
no
rach
and
once
again
she
is
out
of
here

not
i
promised
myself
id
make
it
through
at
least
one
of

i
wanted
was
to
make
it
through
this
evening
with
a
little
bit
of
grace
and
dignity
well
i
guess
we
can
all
agree
thats
not
gonna
happen
i
guess
theres
nothing
really
left
to
say
except
her
name
was
lola
she
was
a
showgirl
with
yellow
feath
feathers
in
her
hair
and
a
dress
cut
down
to
