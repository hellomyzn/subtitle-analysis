totally
against

no
i
am
against
innocent
trees
being
cut
down
in
their
prime
and
their
corpses
grotesquely
dressed
in
like
tinsel
and
twinkly
lights
hey
how
do
you
sleep
at
night
well
im
pretty
tired
from
lugging
the
trees
around
hey
phoebe
listen
you
got
this
all
wrong
those
trees
were
born
to
be
christmas
trees
theyre
fulfilling
their
life
purpose
by
making
people
happy
really
yes
yes
and
uh
the
trees
are
happy
too
because
for
most
of
them
its
their
only
chance
to
see
new
york
after
youve
delivered
the
drinks
you
take
the
tray
gunther
gunther
please
i
have
worked
here
for
two
and
a
half
years
i
know
the
empty
trays
go
over
there
what
if
you
put
them
here
huh
you
know
thats
actually
a
good
idea
theyll
be
closer
to
the
mugs
you
know
what
you
should
have
the
other
waitresses
do
that
too
they
already
do
huh
thats
why
they
call
it
the
tray
spot
i
always
heard
them
talk
about
that
i
just
thought
it
was
a
club
they
went
to
oh
god
im
sorry
its
all
right
sweetheart
so
this
must
be
kind
of
neat
for
you
huh
your
dad
tells
me
you
get
a
couple
of
days
off
school
and
you
dont
have
to
sell
those
cookies
anymore
well
i
kind
of
wanted
to
sell
the
cookies
the
girl
who
sells
the
most
wins
a
trip
to
space
camp
and
gets
to
sit
in
a
real
space
shuttle
wow
you
really
like
all
this
space
stuff
huh
yeah
my
dad
says
if
id
spend
as
much
time
helping
him
clean
apartments
as
i
do
daydreaming
about
outer
space
hed
be
able
to
afford
a
trip
to
the
taj
mahal
i
think
youd
have
to
clean
a
whole
lot
of
apartments
to
go
all
the
way
to
india
no
the
one
in
atlantic
city

how
many
more

to
sell
in
order
to
win
the
girl
who
won
last
year
sold
yeah
so
far
ive
sold

doable
how
much
are
the
boxes
five
dollars
a
box

what
is
second
prize
a
bike
but
id
rather
have
something
