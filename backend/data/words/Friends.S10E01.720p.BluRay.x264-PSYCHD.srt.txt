then
she

right
yeah
you

ive
wanted
to
ask
charlie
out
since
the
day
i
met
her
oh
i
know
i
know
thats
been
really
hard
for
you
anyway
one
thing
led
to
another
and
oh
before
you
know
it
we
were
kissing
how
angry
do
you
think
joeys
gonna
be
that
is
hard
to
say
ross
that
is
hard
to
say
i
gotta
find
him
hes
gotta
be
here
someplace
you
would
think
joey

psst
what
hey
what
are
you
what
is
this
have
you

what
is
this
what
is
this
well
lets
see
we
kissed
for
minutes
and
now
were
talking
to
our
friends
about
it
so
i
guess
this
is
sixth
grade
no
no
have
you
thought
about
how
complicated
this
could
get
what
about
ross
well
hes
with
charlie
now
yeah
but
he
wants
to
talk
to
you
before
anything
really
happens
with
her
and
as
his
friend
i
mean
dont
you
think
he
deserves
the
same
from
you
youre
a
pain
in
my
ass
geller
look
we
appreciate
all
the
advice

this

one
thing
for
us
the
people
that

about
you

not
worth
this
youre
an
attractive
intelligent
woman
and
lets
face
it
mikes
kind
of
a
wang
he
proposed
to
me
while
he
was
still
seeing
you
he
was
gonna
break
up
with
you
on
your
birthday
i
dont
like
to
kiss
and
tell
but
he
cheated
on
you
a
lot
this
weekend
oh
my
god
you
know
maybe
youre
right
maybe
i
dont
need
him
i
deserve
to
be
treated
with
respect
screw
you
mike
youre
a
coward
and
a
bastard
and
i
hope
you
rot
in
hell
youre
welcome
honey
youve
been
in
there
for
a
long
time
is
everything
okay
not
really
i
have
a
problem
really
what
happened
well
i
was
dancing
around
and
singing
no
woman
no
cry
and
um
i
got
stuck
you
cant
move
at
all
oh
i
can
move
ha
ha
if
i
untangle
you
will
you
please
get
rid
of
the
cornrows
i
guess
so
some
of
these
look
a
little
frayed
yeah
i
tried
to
gnaw
myself
free
hey
hi
so
did
you
uh
tell
ross
well
i
tried
but
then
he
had
a
shampoorelated
emergency
so
i
guess
now
its
your
turn
again
no
no
no
no
i
think
its
better
if
you
tell
him
you
know
its
easier
for
a
woman
that
way
you
know
if
he
gets
mad
all
you
have
to
do
is
go
i
didnt
mean
it
im
so
sorry
yeah
because
thats
what
we
do
all
right
all
right
okay
um
how
about
this
how
about
this
tomorrow
mmhm
tomorrow
well
both
go
and
well
tell
him
together
okay
that
sounds
fair
that
just
means
once
again
we
cant
i
know

okay
i
mean
we
can
control
ourselves

not
