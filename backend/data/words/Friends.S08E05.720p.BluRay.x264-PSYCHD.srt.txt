toby

chandler
you
have
to
tell
him
no
that
would
be
so
awkward
besides
we
work
in
different
departments
hes
on
the
sixth
floor
so
he
calls
me
toby
once
in
a
while
big
deal
could
be
worse
its
not
like
hes
calling
me
muriel
muriel
why
would
he
call
you
muriel
oh
my
god
chandler
m
bing
its
not
just
an
m
your
middle
name
is
muriel
shh
it
is
a
family
name
chandler
muriel
bing
your
parents
never
even
gave
you
a
chance
did
they
drake
ive
discovered
the
reason
for
your
headaches
and
memory
loss
what
is
it
apparently
your
brain
transplant
was
not
entirely
successful
it
seems
your
body
is
rejecting
jessicas
brain
is
it
serious
not
if
we
extract
tissue
from
the
original
body
synthesize
antibodies
introduce
them
into
your
system
which
could
stop
you
from
rejecting
the
brain
that
sounds
simple
enough
lets
just
do
that
we
would
but
when
we
went
to
exhume
jessicas
body
it
was
gone
cut
very
nice
people
let
me
change
and
we
can
go
to
dinner
wh
oh
what
happened
to
jessicas
body
