all
he

my
goodness
in

the
one
making
him

yeah
why
why
because
of
the
government
isnt
it
incredible
monica

chandler

so
happy
together
two
best
friends
in
love
how
often
does
that
happen
not
that
often
no
im
so
happy
for

so
happy
for

percent
jealous
whats
percent
thats
nothing
totally
im

yeah
me
too
hey
have
you
guys
seen
chandler
no
but
you
know
who
was
looking
for
you
tennille
so
that
marriage
stuff
you
were
saying
yesterday
you
dont
really
believe
that
sure
i
do
in
fact
i
think
the
whole
concept
of
marriage
is
unnatural
look
at
pigs
lets
take
a
second
here
and
look
at
pigs
pigs
dont
mate
for
life
a
pig
can
have
sexual
partners
in
a
lifetime
and
thats
just
an
ordinary
pig
not
even
a
pig
thats
good
at
sports
wait
a
minute
are
you
telling
me
you
may
never
want
to
get
married
never
say
never
but
probably
yeah
never
oh
my
god
then
what
are
we
even
doing
what
is
this
whoa
whoa
whoa
what
is
all
this
pressure
is
this
some
new
strategy
why
dont
you
put
down
your
copy
of
the
rules
huh
mantrap
you
know
what
i
gotta
go
its
okay
i
got
a
plan
were
gonna
find
love
definitely
yeah
im
pretty
confident
about
that
thats
what
makes
it
so
easy
to
be
percent
happy
for
monica
and
chandler
would
be
nice
to
have
a
guarantee
what
do
you
mean
some
people
make
deals
with
a
friend
like
if
neither
of
them
are
married
by
they
marry
each
other
you
mean
a
backup
exactly
yeah
yeah
ive
got
that
you
do
mmhm
who
joey
joey
are
you
serious
yeah
yeah
i
locked
him
in
years
ago
wait
so
if
neither
of
you
are
married
by
youll
marry
joey
yep
we
shook
on
it
yeah
but
believe
me
that
is
not
how
he
wanted
to
seal
the
deal
seriously
i
think
his
exact
words
were
charming
ah
hes
just
a
backup
yeah
hey
monica
have
you
seen
rachel
or
a
mirror
its
for
my
boat
cool
huh
yeah
its
great
whats
the
matter
talk
to
the
captain
just
realizing
im
in
a
deadend
relationship
chandlers
giving
you
a
hard
time
i
dont
want
to
get
married
tomorrow
but
i
want
to
believe
were
going
somewhere
that
im
not
wasting
my
time
you
know
chandler
no
i
dont
know
chandler
not
anymore
its
like
somethings
changed
maybe
you
changed
i
didnt
change
maybe
thats
the
problem
what
chandler
is
a
complex
fellow
one
who
is
unlikely
to
take
a
wife
does
he
think
ill
just
wait
around
for
nothing
face
it
chandler
is
against
marriage
and
always
will
be
well
theres
some
people
who
do
want
to
marry
me
there
are
yeah
richard
richard
said
he
wants
to
marry
you
and
chandler
says
he
hates
marriage
thats
right
chandler
loves
marriage
you
just
told
me
he
hates
marriage
that
hes
a
complex
fellow
whos
unlikely
to
take
a
wife
that
hes
against
marriage
and
always
will
be
you
got
that
from
what
i
said
rach
hey
you
hey
come
on
in
thank
you
im
so
sorry
to
hear
about
you
and
elizabeth

make
it
work
i
guess
it
just
wasnt
meant
to

a
tricky
business
