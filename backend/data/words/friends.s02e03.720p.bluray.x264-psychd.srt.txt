evolving
over
millions
of
years
from
singlecelled
organisms
is
too
easy
yeah
i
just
dont
buy
it
excuse
me
evolution
is
not
for
you
to
buy
phoebe
evolution
is
scientific
fact
like
the
air
we
breathe
like
gravity
okay
dont
get
me
started
on
gravity
you
uh
you
dont
believe
in
gravity

would
you
look
at
this
dump
he
hated
us
this
was
his
final
revenge

just
dont
look
at
this
funky
shirt
pheebs
ive
studied
evolution
my
entire
adult
life
and
i
can
tell
you
weve
collected
fossils
from
all
over
the
world
that
actually
show
the
evolution
of
different
species
i
mean
you
can
literally
see
them
evolving
through
time
really
you
can
actually
see
it
you
bet
in
the
us
china
africa
all
over
