be
fun
how
drunk
are
you
drunk
enough
that
i
know
i
wanna
do
this
not
so
drunk
that
you
should
feel
guilty
about
taking
advantage
thats
a
perfect
amount
you
know
whats
weird
what
this
doesnt
feel
weird
i
know
youre
a
really

each
other
naked
yep
you
want
to
do
it
at
the
same
time

three
well
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
our
friendship
is
effectively
ruined
eh
we
werent
that
close
anyway
so
are
you
really
gonna
go
out
with
that
nurseman
well
uh
you
and
i
are
just
goofing
around
i
thought
why
not
just
goof
around
with
him
i
dont
know
if
youve
ever
looked
up
the
term
goofing
around
in
the
dictionary
well
i
have
and
the
technical
definition
is
two
friends
who
care
a
lot
about
each
other
and
have
amazing
sex
and
just
want
to
spend
more
time
together
but
if
you
have
this
newfangled
dictionary
that
gets
you
mad
at
me
then
we
have
to
you
know
get
you
my
original
dictionary
i
am
so
bad
at
this
i
think
youre
better
than
you
think
you
are
really
okay
so
if
know
when
to
stop
you
know
i
sensed
that
i
should
stop
so

my
foot
down
