the
matter

whos
barry
and
mindy
barry
was
the
guy
i
almost
married
and
mindy
was
my
best
friend
wasnt
he
cheating
on
you
with
her
that
just
means
he
was
falling
asleep
on
top
of
her
instead
of
me
can
you
imagine
if
id
married
him
how
different
would
my
life
be
i
know
ive
always
wondered
how
different
life
would
be
if
id
never
gotten
divorced
which
time
the
first
time
imagine
if
carol
hadnt
realized
she
was
a
lesbian
i
cant
i
keep
seeing
it
the
good
way
i
bet
id
still
be
doing
my
karate
towards
the
end
of
our
marriage
i
did
karate
as
a
way
of
releasing
the
tension
from
you
know
not
doing
anything
else
physical
maybe
the
problem
was
pronouncing
it
karatay
what
if
i
was
still
fat
you
wouldnt
be
dating
me
thats
for
sure
sure
i
would
what
you
guys
think
im
that
shallow
no
i
think
monica
was
that
fat
hey
imagine
if
id
never
gotten
fired
off
days
of
our
lives
hey
hey
theres
carol
again
what
if
i
had
had
the
guts
to
quit
my
job
id
probably
be
writing
for
the
new
yorker
being
paid
to
be
funny
but
my
jobs
fun
too
i
mean
tomorrow
i
dont
have
to
wear
a
tie
what
if
id
taken
that
job
at
merrill
lynch
what
merrill
lynch
a
massage
client
who
worked
there
said
i
had
a
knack
for
stocks
why
didnt
you
take
it
at
that
time
you
see
i
thought
that
everything
that
rhymed
was
true
so
i
thought
if
i
worked
with
stocks
id
have
to
live
in
a
box
and
only
eat
lox
and
have
a
pet
fox
do
