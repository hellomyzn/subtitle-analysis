that
one
thats
like
the

fun
game
ever
im
sick
of
your
smoking
so
i
brought
something
that
is
going
to
help
you
quit
oh
that
patch
is
no
good
its
a
hypnosis
tape
a
woman
at
work
used
it
for
two
weeks
and
hasnt
smoked
since
ha
whats
your
problem
nothing
its
just
that
hypnosis
is
beyond
crap
i
watched
you
get
hypnotized
in
atlantic
city
that
guy
did
not
hypnotize
me
okay
you
always
pull
your
pants
down
and
play
wipe
out
on
your
butt
forget
hypnosis
the
way
to
quit
smoking
is
to
dance
naked

field
of
heather

then
bathe
in
the
sweat
of
six
