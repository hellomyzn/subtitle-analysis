i

uh
my

stupid
sons
of
bitches
you
didnt

the

what
of

thing
not

to
lie
to
me
im
not
lying
to
you
i

pinocchio
i

no

i
watched
the
tape
did
you
watch
the
tape
no
the
selection
committee
has
chosen
the
three
of
you
as
our
finalists
the
decision
will
be
based
on
the
answers
you
give
to
the
questions
i
ask
well
start
with
dr
li
you
claim
the
field
is
too
reliant
on
the
linnaean
taxonomic
system
how
do
you
propose
to
correct
this
i
believe
that
the
answers
lie
in
the
osteological
evidence
i
plan
to
begin
there
interesting
i
guess
dr
biely
your
proposal
includes
some
fieldwork
where
might
that
take
place
primarily
in
the
pierre
shale
region
of
south
dakota
certainly
very
well
and
dr
geller
when
is
my
birthday
what
i
uh
care
to
venture
a
guess
may
thats
not
even
kind
of
close
dr
li
how
many
graduate
students
will
you
need
half
a
dozen
i
see
and
dr
biely
three
for
excavation
and
two
for
analysis
certainly
dr
geller
which
shirelles
hit
was
later
covered
by
a
popular
british
invasion
band
what
what
i
need
six
graduate
students
no
im
sorry
we
were
looking
for
baby
its
you
baby
its
you
what
wait
just
a
minute
none
of
my
questions

anything
to
do
with
paleontology
youre

slowly
reaches

benji
isnt
in
love
with
me
i

he
broke
up
with

a
very
ethical
man

ethical
to

the
voice
of
underdog
im
sure
he
was
just
joking
if
you
dont

didnt
ask
me
one
paleontological
question

did
ask
me
one
uh

do
you
spell
boscodictiasaur

about
the
crazy
questions
you
wally
cox
thats
the
voice
of
underdog
like
i
tried
to
tell
you
in
the
interview
this
grant
is
not
based
on
your
knowledge
of
