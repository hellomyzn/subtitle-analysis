can
we
talk
about
what
happened
here
last
night
sure
just
give
me
a
second
to
get
all
huffy
and
weird
like
you
you
believe
that
whoever
did
something
last
night
did
what
they
did
or
didnt
do
okay
you
really
dont
know
what
im
talking
about
no
okay
last
night
after
the
party
i
saw
rachel
kissing
that
jerk
from
her
office
out
on
your
balcony
our
balcony
seriously
thats
so
funny
i
told
monica
we
should
put
lights
on
our
balcony
and
she
said
no
no
its
too
cold
nobody
will
go
out
there
and
i
said
maybe
if
we
put
some
lights
out
there
they
will
right
thats
what
i
came
over
to
talk
about
i
saw
rachel
kissing
some
guy
on
your
balcony
even
though
there
were
no
lights
so
are
you
gonna
talk
to
her
why
why
should
i
i
mean
if
she
wants
to
move
on
thats
fine
you
know
when
thats
fine
sounds
true
when
someone
yells
it
and
spits
no
im
serious
i
mean
if
she
wants
to
date
people
fine
i
dont
care
but
at
least
she
could
have
told
me
you
know
ive
been
putting
my
life
on
hold
and
concentrating
on
emma
but
if
she
wants
to
go
out
there
kissing
guys
she
barely
knows
then
so
will
i
very
funny
ross
is
gay
ha
ha
no
no
good
so
youre
moving
on
do
you
have
any
idea
where
youre
moving
on
to
ive
got
plenty
of
opportunities
just
now
there
was
some
woman
at
the
coffeehouse
smiled
at
me
and
then
the
other
day
on
the
subway
a
woman
accidentally
sat
on
my
hand
dude
dont
rub
my
face
in
your
crazy
single
life
and
theres
an
anthropologist
atschool
who
totally
came
on
to
me
during
the
interdepartmental
potluck
dinner
why
did
i
get
married
hey
let
me
ask
you
guys
something
im
having
new
headshots
taken
tomorrow
the
photographer
said
she
thinks
i
should
have
my
eyebrows
waxed
is
that
weird
for
a
guy
well
it
depends
on
on
how
far
along
he
is
in
the
sexchange
process
no
i
totally
disagree
i
think
its
fine
for
a
guy
to
do
something
like
that
especially
an
actor
i
mean
not
that
you
need
to
your
eyebrows
are

a
thin
line
between

so
i
had
fun
last

i
exactly

it
whats
the
matter
whats
ross
doing
to
you
in
that
picture

hes
dusting
me
with
a
fossil
brush
he
thought
it

i
thought
it
was
ross

nothing
going
on
between
you
there
isnt
there
totally
isnt
you
hear
keys
in
the
hall
and
you
jump

bronco
coming
out
of
the
chute
i
used
to
be
a
rodeo
clown
um

gavin
i
guess
i
felt
guilty
that
you
were
here
which
i
shouldnt
you
know
ross
and
i
are
not
in
a
relationship
but
he
is
the

theres
just
so
much
history

know
its
just
i
dont
know
im
sorry
im
just
all
over
the
place
its
okay
its
probably
not
my
place
but
can
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice

talk
to
ross
about
all
this

making
a
big
deal
about
this

time
oh

what
about
the
guy
from
the
bar
who
the
guy
you
gave
your
number
to
how
do
you
know
about
that
because
he
called
here
looking
for
you
so
dont
tell
me
kissing
this
guy
from
work
is
a
onetime
thing
because
youve
been
out
there
in
bars
and
on
balconies
for
over
a
month
now
and
you
dont
even
have
the
courtesy
to
tell
me
why
didnt
i
get
that
message
what
from
the
guy
in
the
bar
why
didnt
i
get
that
message
because
i
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
my
pants
pocket
do
you
do
you
not
look
there
ross
i
never
gave
it
to
you
why
i
dont
know
oh
god
you
know
what
i
dont
who
do
you
think
you
are
who
are
you
to
decide
what
messages
i
should
or
should
not
get
who
am
i
im
the
guy
whos
taking
care
of
our
baby
while
youre
at
bars
meeting
guys
i
cannot
believe
you
i
actually
came
in
here
hoping
to
have
a
mature
conversation
about
us
but
i
cant
do
that
with
someone
who
hides
my
messages
and
brings
crazy
women
back
to
my
apartment
hey
none
of
the
sane
ones
wanted
to
come
back
with
me
thats
not
the
point
okay
the
point
is
you
are
the
one
who
moved
on
and
didnt
tell
anyone
oh
god
ross
this
is
just
so
messed
up
what
is
wrong
with
us
when
people
hear
about
our
situation
they
ask
you
live
together
but
youre
not
a
couple
yet
you
have
a
baby
isnt
that
weird
and
i
say
no
its
not
because
it
works
for
us
but
you
know
what
this
doesnt
work
in
fact
this
is
the
opposite
of
working
clearly
and
you
know
we
said
that
we
would
live
together
as
long
as
this
makes
sense
and
maybe
this
just
doesnt
make
sense
anymore
yeah
maybe
not
so
what
do
you
wanna
do
hey
hi
can
emma
and
i
live
here
for
a
while
god
uh
of
course
thank
you
your
eyebrows
look
weird
jeremiah
was
a
bullfrog
was
a
good
friend
of
mine
never
understood
a
single
word
he
said
but
i
helped
him
drink
his
wine
so
youll
just
touch
yourself
for
anything
then
