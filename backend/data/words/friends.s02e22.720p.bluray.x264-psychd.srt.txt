rachels
birthday
and
we
want

do
we
always
have
to
have
parties
where
you
poach
things
you
wanna
be
in
charge
of
the
food
committee
question
two
why
do
we
always
have
parties
with
committees
yeah
yeah
why
cant
we
just
get
some
pizzas
and
gets
some
beers
and
have
fun
yeah
yeah
i
agree
you
know
i
think
fancy
parties
are
only
fun
if
youre
fancy
on
the
inside
and
im
just
not
sure
we
are
all
right
you
guys
dont
want
it
to
be
special
fine
you
can
throw
any
kind
of
party
you
want
joey
theyre
not
real
huh
huh
i
start
miles
beneath
the
surface
of
these
things
okay
theyre
fake
see
honk
honk
wow
its
like
porno
for
clowns
i
talked
to
rachels
sisters
neither
of
them
can
come
okay
so
i
still
have
to
invite
dylan
and
emma
and
shannon
cooper
whoa
whoa
whoa
uh
no
shannon
cooper
why
not
her
because
she
uh
she
steals
stuff
or
maybe
she
doesnt
steal
stuff
and
joey
slept
with
her
and
never
called
her
back
joey
that
is
horrible
hey
i
liked
her
all
right
maybe
too
much
i
dont
know
i
guess
i
just
got
scared
im
sorry
i
didnt
know
heh
i
didnt
think
anyone
would
buy
that
okay
hi
honey
how
did
it
go
ugh
it
was
the
graduation
from
hell
you
know
my
cousin
went
to
hell
on
a
football
scholarship
you
know
i
mean
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
joyous
occasion
my
sisters
graduating
from
college
nobody
thought
she
would
its
a
true
testament
to
what
a
girl
from
long
island
would
do
for
a
celica
so
what
happened
my
parents
happened
all
they
had
to
do
was
sit
in
the
same
stadium
smile
proudly
and
not
talk
about
the
divorce
but
no
they
got
into
a
huge
fight
in
the
middle
of
the
commencement
address
bishop
tutu
actually
had
to
stop
and
shush
them
ugh
but
you
know
what
you
know
what
the
good
news
is
i
get
to
serve
coffee

the
next
eight
hours

the
fourth
of

reminded
you

the
way
our

used
to
bitch
at
each
other
its
just
this
thing
every
year
we
would
go
out
on
my
dads
boat
and
watch
the
fireworks
mom
always
hated
it
because
the
ocean
air
made
her
hair
all
big
my
sister
jill
would
be
throwing
up
over
the
side
and
my
dad
would
be
upset
because
nobody
was
helping
and
then
when
we
did
help
he
would
scream
at
us
for
doing
it
wrong
but
then
when
the
fireworks
started
everybody
just
shut
up
you
know
and
itd
get
really
cold
and
wed
all
just
sort
of
smoosh
under
this
one
blanket
it
never
occurred
to
anybody
to
bring
another
one
and
now
its
