1
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:13,965
-You brushed your teeth, right?
-What? Shut up, dude.

2
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:19,085
Oh, Lata, it's you!

3
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:21,245
Oh, Lata, it is you!

4
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:23,325
-Is Mom here?
-She will be here soon.

5
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,245
-What's in the bag?
-Chili pepper salsa.

6
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:26,445
What did I eat?

7
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:27,725
-Flatbread and vegetables?
-Yes.

8
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:29,885
-Yes! And what did I eat?
-Eggs!

9
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,645
-Good one.
-May I tell your mom a joke?

10
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,965
Not my mom, but hers--

11
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,485
No, no!

12
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:42,005
No, Sonu. I'll listen to your jokes today.
But just don't tell any joke to my mother!

13
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,285
Idiot! Tell me! I wanna hear it.

14
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:18,805
Dhruv?

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,245
-What's up?
-What are you doing? It's been 20 minutes.

16
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:24,325
Yeah, I know. I'll be right out.

17
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,005
Here, Mom got this for you.

18
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,365
Wow. But we can get this downstairs.

19
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:30,685
Never mind.

20
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,525
-See? That's my mom.
-Wow. Show me.

21
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:35,365
Dude, so nice.

22
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:37,645
-Wow, so pretty.
-This is me.

23
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:39,805
Dude, that's so cute.

24
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:43,605
I asked her to get some old photos.
You also ask your mom.

25
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:45,005
Yes.

26
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:50,965
-You look nice today.
-What?

27
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:53,845
-I look like this every day.
-Really?

28
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,245
Go, sit with her.

29
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:58,965
Yes, I'll come in a minute.

30
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,245
What's wrong? Does it feel awkward?

31
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,405
Yes, it does feel a bit awkward.

32
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,405
I'm freaking out, I don't know why.

33
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,925
-But you've met her before.
-I know.

34
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:13,165
-I don't feel awkward with your parents.
-What a thing to say.

35
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,885
It's a bit more real each time.

36
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:18,925
I understand. It's okay.

37
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,525
What are you doing?

38
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:24,245
Anyway, I'll be fine in five minutes.
What's the plan?

39
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:26,685
The plan is...

40
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,685
I got a call and I have to go to work.
It's important.

41
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,445
-Fuck you, Kulkarni.
-Momo, listen!

42
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:34,565
Don't "Momo" me.

43
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:37,965
It's only a few hours.
You get her to the office after that.

44
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,045
And what about your mom?
What will she think?

45
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,365
She will be upset if I miss work.
Thanks for doing this.

46
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:44,405
What shit!

47
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,725
My neighbor's son is always on a shoot.

48
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:51,485
-Really?
-Poor kid. You wouldn't think he's a kid.

49
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:57,565
Today's parents are eager
for their children to grow up quickly.

50
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,045
-The headache ends.
-It's all due to television.

51
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,165
Making little children work.

52
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:05,965
-Mom?
-Yes?

53
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,325
Coming.

54
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:11,405
-At least eat your breakfast.
-I'm done.

55
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,925
Listen, go to the Gateway of India first.

56
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:16,205
-We went there the last time.
-Yeah.

57
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:19,685
Right. Go to Banganaga,
then eat at Pizza By The Bay.

58
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:22,845
If you want Parsi food, go to Britannia.
Jimmy Boy is also great!

59
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,125
You know what?
Dhruv will take care of lunch.

60
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,485
Wow. Thanks for including me in the plan.

61
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:29,645
Shut up! Then go to Haji Ali and then--

62
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:32,085
-Siddhivinayak.
-Exactly. Perfect.

63
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,605
Your gooseberry juice is in the fridge.

64
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:38,165
-Thank you. Now, go.
-I'm going. Don't send me away like that.

65
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,405
Go via the Sea Link.
The cab has been hired for the whole day.

66
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,405
-You have the number?
-Yes. I have everything.

67
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:46,525
-Perfect. Bye, you guys.
-Bye, honey.

68
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:55,685
-You want to eat?
-I've already eaten.

69
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,885
Let me know when you want to go out.

70
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,165
Okay, take a shower,
and I will get ready as well.

71
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,405
I already showered.

72
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,645
-You showered?
-Yes, in the morning.

73
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:22,845
Since I was in the kitchen,
I didn't notice.

74
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:28,165
Shall I tell you a joke?

75
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:29,925
Sure, go ahead.

76
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:34,205
-Shit, I forgot.
-Oh, yeah?

77
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,845
Are you on your way to Siddhivinayak?

78
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:40,445
Aunty doesn't want to go there.

79
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,285
-Then where are you guys going?
-You won't believe it.

80
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,645
Do you like Shahrukh?

81
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:53,205
-Yes, you could say that.
-He's my favorite.

82
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:56,565
-I'll tell you what.
-Yes?

83
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,485
-I'll go closer and look.
-Sure, go on.

84
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,005
-Maybe I'll see him.
-Maybe you will.

85
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,965
-Listen, take a picture.
-Sure.

86
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:07,685
In front of Mannat. Okay?

87
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:27,805
Look. It's a bit silly, right?

88
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,165
No, not at all.

89
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:32,405
Actually, my mom got a picture
just like that, too. Exactly the same.

90
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,525
-Really?
-Yes. When she visited.

91
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,285
Sir, let's go towards Marine Drive.

92
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:44,885
Since we are in the neighborhood,
shall we see Aamir's home as well?

93
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,285
Sure. Sir, do you know
where Aamir's home is?

94
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:52,485
-This wasn't fun.
-Why not?

95
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,805
He's such a huge star,
he's done such big movies.

96
00:05:55,925 --> 00:06:01,125
<i>Lagaan, 3 Idiots, PK.</i>
And he lives in an apartment.

97
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:02,205
You are right.

98
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,965
Shall we go to Marine Drive? Or we
will get late and get stuck in traffic.

99
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:10,325
-One last thing. Please.
-Why are you saying please?

100
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,205
We'll go where ever you like, okay?

101
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:15,205
Glamour building is in Bandra, right?

102
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:16,245
-Glamour?
-Yes.

103
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,765
Who lives in Glamour?

104
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,765
You haven't changed at all.
You look the same.

105
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:24,445
So do you! I wish you had called.

106
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:25,925
How come you're here?

107
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:29,365
Dhruv is showing me around.
My daughter's friend.

108
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,325
Why is he standing there? Come here.

109
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:35,365
-She is well? How old is she?
-She is 27 and a half.

110
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:40,725
-She's well, happy.
-You would know better.

111
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:42,085
Quiet.

112
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:49,045
-You're meeting after a long time?
-Yes.

113
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,005
-It's been 18 years.
-Eighteen years?

114
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:51,925
-Yes.
-Yes.

115
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,965
She was never in town
when I came to Mumbai.

116
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,565
-I know.
-This time,

117
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,325
I thought let me try
and see if I can meet her.

118
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:03,165
I'm very glad.
But next time, stay at my place.

119
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:04,765
-Yes.
-Yes, we'll have fun.

120
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,965
We'll ask Aparna to join us.
She'll come from Pune.

121
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:09,685
Yes, the whole gang will be together.
It will be great.

122
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,805
Gang, yes.

123
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,765
-We had a lot of fun together.
-Yes.

124
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:16,285
The first time we bunked school,

125
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:20,085
first film, first cigarette,
first beer, first kiss.

126
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:26,445
Sorry.

127
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,485
How about some tea or coffee?

128
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,685
No, some other time.

129
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:34,085
-We're running late.
-Sure?

130
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:36,125
You're going to Juhu, right?

131
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,725
Go to a store called Ashok, number 34.

132
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:41,205
Make sure you have <i>pav bhaji</i> there.

133
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:44,525
My goodness, you still remember
that I love <i>pav bhaji?</i>

134
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:45,445
Of course!

135
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:53,765
Open the message. A, B, C.
Click on A. And then...

136
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:57,165
there it is. That's how.

137
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,005
-Wow.
-Simple.

138
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:03,405
One minute. I'll send you a hello.

139
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,205
Okay.

140
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:15,085
-See? I got it. Hello.
-Wow.

141
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:16,685
This is so easy.

142
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:22,805
Where did you eat <i>pav bhaji</i> from?

143
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:27,325
<i>-Pav bhaji. </i>From an auto rickshaw.
-From an auto rickshaw?

144
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:30,845
You were bound to have an upset stomach

145
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:33,885
if you had <i>pav bhaji</i> at 4 in the morning
from an auto rickshaw.

146
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:39,565
What happened was that the municipality
got rid of all the food stands.

147
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,285
And Aakash and I were starving.

148
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:46,485
-Aakash. You both went to his wedding?
-Yes, Kavya and I attended it.

149
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:48,485
So, anyway, we were hungry

150
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:51,325
and we saw an auto rickshaw guy
just outside the hostel.

151
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,285
We went to see what he was doing.

152
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:57,045
He was making <i>pav bhajis</i>
on a stove in the auto rickshaw.

153
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,285
And we were so hungry
we asked him to make some for us.

154
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:03,125
We took the <i>pav bhaji</i> to our room.

155
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:06,045
My stomach went crazy
two hours after eating it.

156
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,925
So now even hearing about it
gives me a bad taste in my mouth.

157
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:13,525
After that day,
I never ate that again.

158
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:16,365
-I can't.
-Now I get it.

159
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:19,125
When you said you don't eat <i>pav bhaji,</i>

160
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:24,365
I thought to myself that there is nothing
that Dhruv does not eat.

161
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:29,645
I mean, it's a compliment.

162
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,885
You're a foodie, right?

163
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:43,005
Do your parents know that
the two of you live together?

164
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:45,765
Yes, Aunty. They know everything.

165
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,565
You're serious about each other, right?

166
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:54,245
-Yes, full power. Don't worry about it.
-Full power?

167
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:56,565
I mean,
we're quite serious about each other.

168
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:58,445
Okay.

169
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,645
-Kavya is all right, isn't it?
-Yes, she is.

170
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,645
-She's just busy.
-Yes.

171
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:09,525
She's very happy with her new job
and very busy as well.

172
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:13,125
-Does that trouble you?
-No.

173
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:17,685
You know, the first time
we got Kavya to the beach,

174
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:22,725
she couldn't understand where
all the water came from.

175
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:25,845
-So cute.
-And she kept asking,

176
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:31,045
"Where does the water end?
Why can't we see anything beyond it?

177
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:34,045
-What is beyond it?"
-So cute.

178
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:39,885
She was so excited.
And very confused, too.

179
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:44,845
If it was happening now,
take out your phone and record.

180
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,885
Yes, but I don't know.

181
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:55,125
Maybe if we had recorded it,
I wouldn't have remembered it.

182
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:12,085
I'm sorry about what Anu said.

183
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,205
No, Aunty. Why the apology?

184
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:18,085
-It was awkward for you.
-No, not at all.

185
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:20,845
Please, don't think that.

186
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,405
I have a request.

187
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:27,645
Sure. Tell me.

188
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:35,925
Please, don't tell Kavya what Anu said.

189
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,125
I mean, it's not right.

190
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,165
I'm her mother, so...

191
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:48,725
No. I won't tell her. Don't worry.

192
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,205
-I'm trusting you.
-Yes.

193
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,925
-You promise?
-I promise.

194
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,725
Thank you.

195
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:09,885
Mom, come and eat with us.

196
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:13,365
-Yes, Aunty, please, come.
-Please, come, Aunty.

197
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:18,365
Son-in-law, go help her.
Come on. Get up. Quickly.

198
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,605
I should go and help her.

199
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:24,365
-Sit down, idiot.
-What's the matter?

200
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:26,645
You forgot to wash your hands?

201
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,725
No, I did.

202
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,165
-Put the phone away.
-Just one--

203
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,365
-Put it away.
-One for Insta.

204
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:37,005
-Do it later. Put the phone away.
-Okay.

205
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:42,845
-I love the lentils.
-Seriously.

206
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:45,885
Is it just me, or does it need
a little more salt?

207
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,885
-The salt is just right. I love it.
-It's perfect.

208
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:50,525
It's my mom's specialty.

209
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:54,085
The lentils need more salt. Add this.

210
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,165
Thank you, Aunty, thank you.

211
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:58,525
Needs more salt.

212
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:01,765
Guy, what are you doing?

213
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:04,845
-What happened?
-Nothing, Mom. Just come.

214
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,405
You have no more flatbread.

215
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,085
Mine? No, I'm fine.

216
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,605
-Take it, honey.
-No, please.

217
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:19,005
-One more won't hurt.
-Carbs, Ma.

218
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,285
-Carbs.
-Yes, you can leave.

219
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:26,685
Kavya, think of Dhruv.
He can't even make tea.

220
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,965
Aunty, she's kidding.
I know how to make tea.

221
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,965
You've had it and it was great, right?
I made it with cardamom.

222
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,005
I know he makes great tea.

223
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:36,245
-Go on, tell us. Why are you nervous?
-I am nervous?

224
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:37,845
-Go on.
-Who is nervous?

225
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:40,845
How are things on Tinder? Tell us.

226
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:44,365
Why are you nervous? Tell us.
Having fun?

227
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:45,325
What is Tinder?

228
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,525
It brings people together
for work meetings.

229
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,885
For work meetings. It sorts everything.

230
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,845
Mom, that's all you're going to have?

231
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:58,365
-Carbs.
-Funny. Good one.

232
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:02,845
-Why are you flattering her?
-Listen, tell me something.

233
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:06,685
Why doesn't Aamir Khan live in a bungalow?

234
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,445
He must be living in one.

235
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,925
He must have shifted
after his second marriage.

236
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,205
No, he's always lived in an apartment.

237
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,685
-No.
-Yes!

238
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:17,725
-How does she know all this?
-I know this.

239
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:20,565
-What's that road? Pali Wali?
-Pali Hill.

240
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:21,845
Bandra. We went there.

241
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:24,005
I didn't see any hill.

242
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,565
They call the steep road a hill.

243
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:28,645
He's making things up.

244
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,285
I'll have some lentils.

245
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:32,365
-Take from this.
-What?

246
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:35,245
-What are you doing?
-I got excited and took too much.

247
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,525
-Eat it.
-I did.

248
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:40,125
-That was for the photo.
-I ate it.

249
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,445
-Yeah.
-Tell me, shall I take more?

250
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:45,605
-Kavya, you didn't eat anything.
-No, Mom, I am very full.

251
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:46,565
I'm done.

252
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:15,165
Aunty, your cab will be here
in two minutes.

253
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:18,085
You're not going out
of your way for me, right?

254
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,365
-Don't worry, Mom.
-It's on the way.

255
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,245
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

256
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:29,965
-Bye.
-Bye.

257
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,125
-Bye, son.
-Bye, Aunty.

258
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:38,805
-Bye.
-Bye.

259
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:43,245
Listen, there are cashews and almonds
in the kitchen. On the top shelf.

260
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,085
-Have them.
-Shit! Just a minute.

261
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:48,405
What happened? What's the matter with her?

262
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,645
-I don't know. The cab is here, right?
-Yes.

263
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,325
-This.
-What is this?

264
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:54,925
Lata's chili pepper salsa
and gooseberry juice.

265
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,685
-You wanted them.
-Thank you.

266
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:00,205
I hope she likes the sari.

267
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:02,245
What did Sonu say the last time?

268
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:07,045
Sonu said,
"My mom gave that sari to her mom."

269
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,285
My sweet child.

270
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,845
-Let me walk you out.
-No, honey.

271
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,085
-We'll take her.
-You are tired.

272
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:17,645
-Okay.
-Bye, guys. Good night.

273
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:19,245
-Thanks.
-Okay.

274
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:20,885
-Bye, Aunty.
-Bye.

275
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:23,445
-Love you, honey.
-Love you, too.

276
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:40,565
-Hey, Tinku. Come here.
-I don't feel like it.

277
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,525
What difference does it make?

278
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,005
Where do memes come from?
Who invented them?

279
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:55,765
But they help to pass the time
and entertain.

280
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,445
You okay?

281
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,685
-How are you feeling?
-Good. Great. Amazing.

282
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:15,045
Listen, did Aunty say anything about me?

283
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:17,565
What? Nothing?

284
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,605
When could she have said anything?
You were with her all the time.

285
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,925
-I'll ask her in a few days.
-Yes, ask.

286
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:30,125
-Did she say anything about me?
-Yes, just general stuff.

287
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,925
How is she? How is she doing?

288
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:34,005
How is her work?
She is busy these days, right?

289
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,605
Yes, she is busy with her work.

290
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,205
I miss her already.

291
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,085
You will see her soon.

292
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:48,165
You shouldn't have brought up that
Tinder thing with Akshara.

293
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:51,765
She's trying to get over that guy.
You should have let her be.

294
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:55,325
-Dude, it was just a small joke.
-I know.

295
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:58,245
Anyway, she started it.

296
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:00,685
Do you want some green tea?

297
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:04,525
Or do you want your chamo... whatever?

298
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,205
-I'll have my chamomile.
-Cool.

299
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,725
Dhruv, you know, sometimes I think...

300
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:15,245
the way our parents got married
is so nice, right?

301
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,845
As in? Love marriage or arranged marriage?

302
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,685
No, I'm not talking in terms of
love marriage or arranged marriage.

303
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:24,965
Just think about it.

304
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,565
Whatever they share is so nice.

305
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,885
They've spend all their lives
 just with each other.

306
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:38,445
Every experience that they've shared,
it's only been with that one person.

307
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:39,925
That's so nice.

308
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:43,885
I mean, they've not even kissed
anyone else but each other.

309
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,485
Isn't that nice?

310
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:54,005
Yeah, it's actually very nice.

311
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:55,965
What?

312
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:57,485
What?

313
00:18:58,885 --> 00:18:59,805
No, what?

314
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:02,885
What, what, why?

315
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,885
I know that face, Dhruv.
I know what it means.

316
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:08,605
What face? What are you talking about?

317
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:10,325
-You want green tea?
-Tell me.

318
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,605
-What are you doing? Tell you what?
-Say it.

319
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,445
-Say what?
-Dhruv.

320
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:22,565
Kavya.

321
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:29,645
You know...

322
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,885
I will feel really bad about myself.

323
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,645
I feel like that already. Inside.

324
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,485
Please. Please, let this go.

325
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,565
Fine. Swear on my life.

326
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,725
Swear on my life and promise
that you will not tell Aunty.

327
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,085
What are you doing?

328
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,725
You haven't crossed your toes, right?

329
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:53,885
Dhruv, shut up!

330
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:57,045
This is important for the future.
I'm telling the truth. I'm not kidding.

331
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:57,965
What happened?

332
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:09,725
-Dude, you can't tell her.
-I won't.

333
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:14,205
-You swore.
-Dhruv, this is not about you.

334
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,045
What did she say about her first kiss?

335
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,325
She just said first kiss. I don't know.

336
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,605
Yes, but was it Mom
or was it someone else?

337
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:26,645
Obviously, this was something
I wasn't going to ask about.

338
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:29,725
What are you thinking?

339
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:32,005
Why wouldn't she tell me this?

340
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:34,365
Because mothers won't tell their kids
about first kiss.

341
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:37,405
Why not? And it's not
just about this kiss, okay?

342
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:40,445
She has this childhood friend
living here for I don't know how long,

343
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:43,325
and I don't even know who she is!
Who is this woman?

344
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:47,765
She kept saying she keeps traveling,
haven't met for a while--

345
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:51,005
This is too frustrating.
Why can't she share this with me?

346
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:53,445
What did she say afterwards?

347
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,365
Nothing. Don't tell Kavya
because I'm her mother,

348
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:58,405
-it won't be nice if she comes to know.
-Nice!

349
00:20:58,485 --> 00:20:59,965
Why does she have to be nice?

350
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:03,485
Why does everything have to be nice?
Why is that important?

351
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:07,325
Why can't she be herself for once with me
and not be nice?

352
00:21:07,445 --> 00:21:09,605
You know, even when Grandpa feel ill
she didn't tell me.

353
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:12,325
-Am I a child?
-You are a child.

354
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,405
I mean, you are a child. Her child.

355
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,205
You're not really a child.
You are a working woman.

356
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:23,125
Do you know I have a feeling that I will
never really know who this person is!

357
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:25,845
She's so busy being my mother,
she's so busy being nice

358
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,645
that I'm never going to know her!

359
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:32,245
Isn't that sad?

360
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:39,125
-Will this happen to us, too?
-No.

361
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,245
Why will we make the same mistake?

362
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:43,085
But it's such a depressing thought.

363
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:46,205
-Are you getting what I'm trying to say?
-Yeah.

364
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,285
I understand.

365
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:51,325
There will be things about my mother
that I will not know because--

366
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:53,805
Yeah, because they are going to
remain mothers.

367
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:56,165
They are never going to be themselves
with us.

368
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:01,525
I think I should talk to her.

369
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,725
No, you're not talking to her. You--

370
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:05,245
Not about this, Dhruv!

371
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,605
I'll have a normal conversation with her.

372
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:09,765
What do you mean by normal?

373
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:12,845
You talk to her every day, right?

374
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,325
Yes, I do that.

375
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:19,525
I think I should talk to her
about our sex life.

376
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:22,845
What? Are you crazy? What are you saying?

377
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:27,045
No, please, okay?

378
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:29,365
I have to do something.

379
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,885
Shit! Your chamomile tea!

380
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:58,885
-What happened? Whose message was it?
-Mom's.

381
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:02,805
-Did she say anything about me?
-Dhruv!

382
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:06,285
What?

383
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:10,845
Why are you getting annoyed?
I'm just asking. It's a normal question.

384
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:14,685
She just said she's reached the station
and she's left some money.

385
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,365
What can we do?

386
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,205
Now my mom is calling.
Listen, it's very simple.

387
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:28,245
Just go on a holiday with her
for a few days,

388
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,325
spend time with her. Maybe that's the
thing! You haven't spent time with her.

389
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:34,045
Maybe it's about that. Okay?
Just give me a second.

390
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,125
Hi, <i>Nadi.</i>

391
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,805
