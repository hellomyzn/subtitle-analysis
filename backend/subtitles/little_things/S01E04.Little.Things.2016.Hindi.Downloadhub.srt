1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,600
Dude, you turned out to be
Santa Claus, man!

2
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,000
Where are you, bro?

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,880
What is this, Kavu?

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,400
Okay, please wrap up quickly.
I'm starving.

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,840
Yeah, I'm waiting downstairs.
Get here quickly. Yup.

6
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,960
Yes, dude, where are you?

7
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,120
Yes, just come straight down.
Straight, straight.

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,040
It left! He's not going to wait that long.

9
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,000
Where are you?

10
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Yeah, you can see paan shop?
Take a left from there!

11
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,440
What do you see? No, man. Not the temple.

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,480
Where is this guy?

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,840
He's right there, Dhruv!

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
Okay, you've reached the spot.
Just stay where you are.

15
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
No, we don't need this.

16
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,760
-Just get us two mutton cutlet-gravy--
-Just one.

17
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
We'll share, won't we?

18
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,800
-Bring it with bread on the side.
-The mutton cutlet gravy is over.

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,960
Can you check again?
I'm sure you'll find one piece.

20
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
I've checked it thoroughly,
and it's not there.

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,360
-Can you go ask once again?
-I'm telling you, I checked everything.

22
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,880
Sir, we've come here from very far.
Please go and take a look.

23
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,280
If you want anything else tell me.

24
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
Bring two mutton biryanis.

25
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,520
-Just one.
-What?

26
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,400
-Just get one mutton biryani.
-Two or one?

27
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,720
Just one.

28
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,000
One?

29
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,840
I haven't eaten since morning.

30
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,800
I only ate biscuits with the hope
of having mutton cutlet gravy.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
That's also over.

32
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,440
Are you kidding?

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,600
You should have come earlier.
Everything is over by this hour.

34
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
Okay, get us the best thing
that's available at this hour.

35
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,840
-So, I'll bring scrambled eggs and bread.
-Wow, scrambled eggs and bread!

36
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,840
So, I took a two-hour trip
to eat scrambled eggs and bread?

37
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,800
Just relax.

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,720
-Make a four egg scramble.
-Four egg scramble?

39
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,680
Who eats a four egg scramble?

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,840
You eat it, Dhruv.

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,160
How can I eat a four egg scramble?
No, get a two egg scramble.

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,280
-Four eggs or two?
-Sir, just two eggs.

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,720
You forgot and you already ate.
What's the point of coming today?

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,280
What's with the formality?

45
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
Bro, add a caramel custard to the bill.

46
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
Not available.

47
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Where are the cabs?

48
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
Over there.

49
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,520
Finally found a cab.

50
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,240
Sir, please drop us to Powai.

51
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,440
No, dude. I'm not going.

52
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
I wanna go home and
watch the new episode of <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

53
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,880
We can watch it tomorrow, Dhruv.

54
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
-We decided five days ago!
-I don't have a calendar fixed in my mind.

55
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,680
Don't say things for the sake of it!

56
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
and haven't watched a single scene!

57
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,720
-I bought popcorn.
-Guys, get off and fight!

58
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,440
Have some shame!

59
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
Shame? Why are you being such a mom?

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,480
Dude, don't say emo stuff like that!
It fucks with my head.

61
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Please, Kavu, there's still time.
We can still get out of here.

62
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,760
Is there more?

63
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
Go on, dude. Have some.

64
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,560
-I don't eat this.
-It's awesome.

65
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,240
Kavu. Where are you?

66
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
Crazy girl. You're up to no good.

67
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,840
He's an ass.

68
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,920
Now, who is this Asif?

69
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
It was amazing.

70
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,560
Potato.

71
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,560
Loose motions.

72
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,600
Come on, it's just a game.

73
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Is that right?

74
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,960
What do you think?
You'll do this all by yourself?

75
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,640
Who are you checking out?

76
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,840
Look at her.

77
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,880
But how could they let Hodor die?

78
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,440
I told you this will happen at the party.

79
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,720
But it didn't happen at the party,
we found out in the lift!

80
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
What the hell, man!

81
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,240
And I have this coupon from Little App.

82
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
All right. I'll bring it.

83
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,480
-Say.
-Yeah, there's Liverpool over there.

84
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Chicken shawarma.

85
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,320
They've made it so well! Full power.

86
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,920
So, I figured,

87
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,840
And anyway,

88
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,480
Is that so?

89
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,720
You were making such a fuss
before getting there.
