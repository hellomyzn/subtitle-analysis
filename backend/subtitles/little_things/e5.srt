1
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:12,325
-Would you like some tea, brother?
-Yes, please, sister.

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,805
Wow, four out of five.

3
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:24,045
-Not bad, Sonu. You're doing great. Stud.
-Do you want to hear a joke?

4
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,845
Yes. Go for it.

5
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:34,245
A guy was eating some street food and
he sneezed and farted at the same time.

6
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,445
So, he said, "Great, whoever
just remembered me

7
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,165
also bust my ass."

8
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,805
Are you crazy? Where did you hear that?

9
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:46,685
-Did he make a mistake again, brother?
-No, no mistake.

10
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:49,045
Mom, I recited the Moon poem for him.

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:53,205
Yes, the Moon poem.
You are very smart, Sonu.

12
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:56,885
Okay, let's go. Bye, brother.
By the way, when is sister back?

13
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,525
She was supposed
to come back today.

14
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:03,765
But I think she murdered someone.

15
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:06,165
I can't get to her on the phone,
and when I do, she doesn't talk.

16
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:08,325
Maybe she is on the run.

17
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:10,245
-It was on the news.
-It was, right?

18
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:11,805
-They showed a photo, too.
-Exactly.

19
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:14,765
-They said she is on the run.
-Yes.

20
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:15,885
Who is on the run?

21
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,085
Moving on to the next award now
and the winner for

22
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:21,885
Glucon-D Most Enthusiastic Employee
goes to Chadda Sir.

23
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:28,125
Madam. Chadda Madam.

24
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,205
-So, how many awards are left?
-Nine.

25
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,525
No.

26
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:46,085
Can't believe we go through this
every year.

27
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:48,365
It'll be another half an hour.

28
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:52,565
Dude, I'm going to die.
Please, give me the lemonade.

29
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,565
I don't mind being bored like this,
but don't like the process.

30
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:58,765
<i>Miss Goa 2018, how are you?</i>

31
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:01,045
<i>Guess what? I have a holiday today.</i>

32
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:03,165
<i>Dhruv! Not again.</i>

33
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:05,885
<i>It's the founder's death anniversary.</i>

34
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,765
<i>-How's your hangover?</i>
<i>-Don't ask. I feel like shit.</i>

35
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:13,605
<i>-I'm sure you look like shit.</i>
<i>-Shut up.</i>

36
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,565
<i>I'm going to jump on you</i>
<i>when I see you.</i>

37
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:19,165
<i>I've been eating a lot of junk</i>
<i>so that my bones don't hurt you.</i>

38
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:22,085
<i>Listen to this joke. There was a man</i>
<i>who was eating street food--</i>

39
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:24,325
<i>Listen, I've got to go. Talk to you later.</i>

40
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,365
<i>Hey! You ruined the joke.</i>

41
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,605
Hey, I'm serious.

42
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:07,485
And that's me at the top of Khardung La.

43
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:11,245
Khardung La anyone?
Okay, for those who don't know,

44
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:15,605
Khardung La happens to be the highest
motorable road in the world.

45
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:17,685
-Wow.
-In the world.

46
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,405
And this was kind of a special day for me.

47
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:23,205
Not for the right reasons, though.

48
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,765
I woke up with 101 fever.

49
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,445
Yeah. And everyone around me
gave the same reaction,

50
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:33,325
they said,
"Brother, you are going to die."

51
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:37,245
But I had waited for this moment
for the last 10 years of my life.

52
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:40,285
And I couldn't just let it go.

53
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,765
So I told myself,

54
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:46,765
"Raunak, even if something
happens to you

55
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,725
while you are chasing your dreams,

56
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:51,325
you wouldn't die with any regrets.

57
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,605
You will never look back and say what if."

58
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:59,045
-What a bunch of crap, so cliche.
-He's so hot.

59
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,565
So, if you feel something
in your heart,

60
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,285
or if you have a dream,

61
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,325
just go and take a chance on yourself.

62
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:10,205
And you'd be surprised at what life
has to give you back in return.

63
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,165
And if nothing else...

64
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:18,845
at least a cool profile picture.

65
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,365
Pay attention to that dream carefully.

66
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:28,005
-What?
-Pay attention to that dream carefully.

67
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,445
Correct. Applause.

68
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,405
That's all, ladies and gentlemen.

69
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,885
What's going on there?

70
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,885
-Let's take a selfie, too.
-No, thanks.

71
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:57,765
-The mountain dog doesn't sleep much--
-Doesn't eat much, either.

72
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:59,245
But he's very active.

73
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,925
But the city dogs sleep all day.

74
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:04,045
-Hi.
-Hello.

75
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,365
-How much is it?
-25 but you can give me 20.

76
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,685
-Twenty?
-You won't get it for less.

77
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:11,285
That's what I am saying.
It's 50 in Mumbai.

78
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,525
-Petrol prices.
-He's right.

79
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:18,325
-The prices of global crude oil...
-Thank you.

80
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,685
affect the prices of transportation.

81
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,885
And which is the second largest factor

82
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:25,565
that affects the prices
of fruits and vegetables.

83
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:27,685
We bargain with these people,

84
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:31,245
when actually it is Trump
and the sheikhs to be blamed for it.

85
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,525
-Interesting.
-You're Kavya, right?

86
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:34,805
-Yes.
-And what did you win?

87
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:37,125
It is called Mentos No Lack of Ideas.

88
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:38,645
What?

89
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:43,125
It basically means I am extremely idle
and I have a lot of time to think about

90
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:46,245
great ideas to make your dull day fun.

91
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:49,285
But tell me something.
Doesn't the routine get to you?

92
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,965
-I doubt I can ever--
-I know what you mean.

93
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:55,765
But the thing is that not everyone
is unhappy with their corporate job.

94
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:58,085
-What about you?
-I think I'm happy.

95
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,565
I mean, when I quit my previous job,

96
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:03,005
I tried to do a lot of different things,

97
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:06,965
like, I tired my hand at pottery,
at organic farming,

98
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,405
I even did graphic designing
for some time.

99
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:11,685
-Really?
-When I was doing all of this,

100
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:15,525
I realized that I was really missing
the structure of things.

101
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,685
The financial security.

102
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:21,325
The great Indian middle class values.

103
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:25,165
-Nice view, right?
-Very.

104
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:29,245
Yes, I got the chilies and the gram flour.

105
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:33,565
Yes, coriander, too.
Okay, Aunty. I will let you know.

106
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:37,405
Yes. I got the gram flour.
All right. Okay, Aunty.

107
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,325
-Making <i>pitla bhakri,</i> brother?
-Yes, sister.

108
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:44,845
Okay, thank you.

109
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:47,965
You know what this light reminds me of?

110
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,325
The evening prayers?

111
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,125
That also.

112
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:55,085
But there is a place called Chaudandas.

113
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,605
It is somewhere around 80 kilometers away
from Almora.

114
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,165
So a couple of years back
I was crossing it.

115
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,525
And the highway police told me that

116
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:06,245
I should spend the night at Chaudandas
because there were some landslides.

117
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,405
I was very tired. So I slept.

118
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,325
Now, after a few hours,

119
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:16,885
I wake up to this general banter, okay?

120
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:22,005
And I see some 20, 30 men
who have gathered for tea and biscuits.

121
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:25,565
And what was surprising was
that they were telling each other stories.

122
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,685
Like, romantic stories, folk tales.

123
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:30,925
These grown men
telling each other stories, right?

124
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:34,645
I was very surprised. I went to one
of the guys asked, "Is today special?"

125
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,285
He said, "No, this happens every day."

126
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:41,925
-That's interesting, but how come...
-So...

127
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,285
turns out that about five years ago,

128
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:49,325
some dude must have gifted them
a radio set, okay?

129
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:51,925
Now that radio set
became everything for them.

130
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,405
That was the only source of entertainment.

131
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:58,125
So after work, everybody would
gather around and listen to the radio.

132
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:01,205
So music, news, information for farmers,

133
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:02,725
basically anything and everything.

134
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:07,205
And one day that radio stopped working.

135
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,245
Oh, no. Then?

136
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,205
They tried everything.
They tried everything to fix it.

137
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,005
But they couldn't. So, eventually,
they got fed up with the radio set,

138
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,925
but they had to fill that void, right?

139
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,045
So they started telling
each other stories.

140
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:24,565
-Okay, wow.
-Yeah.

141
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:28,565
So somewhere in India right now, 6:30,

142
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:31,285
as a "routine"

143
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,405
people are telling each other stories.

144
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:39,485
Wow, it's...

145
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:42,405
It's like walking into a library

146
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:45,005
and suddenly books start
talking to each other.

147
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,205
Yeah.

148
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,645
I think that's how I'm going to end
the story from now on.

149
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:54,685
Thank you.

150
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:59,885
Also routine isn't too bad
as you must have realized.

151
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,925
-Sure.
-Kavya!

152
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,765
I need to pee, bro. Let's go.

153
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:11,365
-Okay. So, stay in touch, maybe?
-Yeah. You, too.

154
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,405
You know what?
Actually I'm coming to Bombay.

155
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:18,245
I'm planning to do the Western Ghat
stretch in 23 days.

156
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,245
-Wow, it's that specific?
-I love to plan.

157
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,365
Never works out though.

158
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:27,165
So if you are free around that time,

159
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:29,525
maybe you could take me around?

160
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:33,205
Yeah, my boyfriend and I
can show you around.

161
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:38,325
-Why not? Yeah.
-Yeah?

162
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,285
-9819...
-Yeah.

163
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,765
573295.

164
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,445
All right. See you.

165
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,205
-See you.
-See you.

166
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:22,965
My sloth beer.

167
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,405
It's not "beer" Dhruv. Bear!

168
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,645
-Yeah, yeah. How are you?
-Good.

169
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,965
Hug properly.
We're meeting after three days.

170
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,605
Did you get the bathroom slippers?

171
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,245
Yeah? And the bathrobe?

172
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,005
-I'm not stealing a bathrobe for you.
-Why not?

173
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:51,645
You've done it before.

174
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,325
-I got you bebinca cake.
-Really?

175
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:57,885
Dude, fuck, but I can't eat this.
Give me your hand. Feel this.

176
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,645
Can you feel them? Dude, man boobs.

177
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:03,165
It's really scary.

178
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:05,725
Guneet says that
after a while they never go away.

179
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:08,245
How scary is that?
I've got man boobs, dude.

180
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:15,725
Kavu, you okay?

181
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,605
Yeah, I'll just shower and come.

182
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:20,485
Yeah, you must be tired.

183
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:23,405
Okay, we'll have dinner when you're done.

184
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:24,805
Okay.

185
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,485
You should get that shower fixed, Dhruv.

186
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,525
Blueberry shower gel?

187
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:08,365
-Blueberry with honey.
-Smells nice, dude.

188
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:11,245
<i>-Pithla bhakri?</i>
-Yes.

189
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:14,165
-Some new Maharashtrian place?
-Yes.

190
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:18,445
-How's it?
-It tastes exactly like my mom's.

191
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:22,005
-What? Really? Okay.
-It's really nice.

192
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:23,405
What place is this?

193
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:26,125
Well, this is...
One second, even I want to try.

194
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:30,925
Momo's kitchen.

195
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,365
-You made this?
-Yeah.

196
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:37,605
Before going to the offsite you said

197
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:39,685
that you are craving
your mother's <i>pithla bhakri.</i>

198
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:41,605
So I thought I'll ask her for the recipe.

199
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,565
It's actually pretty simple.

200
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,125
You really do like it, right?

201
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:47,885
Very nice.

202
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,805
I think I followed
the instructions correctly.

203
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:57,405
She even called me twice, thrice
to ask me how I'm doing. So sweet.

204
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:02,205
By the way,
Aakash's cousin has sent the video,

205
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:03,925
for dance practice.

206
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:07,445
It's a good dance. It should be simple.
We'll manage. No problem.

207
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:09,205
Send it.

208
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:12,205
What is up?

209
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,125
-What do you mean?
-What is up?

210
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:21,405
Dude, there is some wrong.

211
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:24,605
You are not smiling like a fool
and you should be.

212
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:27,925
And you haven't taken a photo of this
and put it on your Instagram story.

213
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:29,725
So there is something definitely wrong.

214
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,125
Let's just enjoy this, Dhruv.

215
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,965
This is not how one enjoys. None
of us is going to be able to enjoy.

216
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:37,885
Tell me!

217
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:43,845
What's that "hmm"? Is that a yes or a no?

218
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,685
Dude, why do people write "hmm"
while texting?

219
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,485
Isn't it like so fucking pointless?

220
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,005
Yo!

221
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:56,525
What?

222
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:01,405
If I ask you something,
will you be honest with me?

223
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:02,925
Yeah.

224
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:05,485
Promise?

225
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,925
Yes, dude, I made it.

226
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,285
With my own hands.

227
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,045
It's very easy. I made it.

228
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,045
-I know, Dhruv.
-Then what?

229
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,885
Dhruv, do you ever feel like...

230
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,005
you should have dated someone else?

231
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:26,885
What?

232
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:28,485
Answer me.

233
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:32,365
What do you mean answer you?
No. I mean...

234
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,485
I don't thinks so, no.

235
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:36,085
I am with you,

236
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:38,725
I'm having <i>pithla bhakri,</i> I stay here,

237
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,605
and I am very happy, dude.

238
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,565
-Okay.
-I mean, I'm...

239
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,645
-It's good.
-Okay.

240
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:47,565
-Let's make this easier for you.
-Yeah, okay.

241
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:51,445
What is the kind of girl you wanted to
date when you were in college?

242
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:54,565
Wait. Are you asking me my type?

243
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:58,605
After all these years,
you are asking me my type?

244
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,765
I think maybe you are my type.

245
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:07,805
Dude, I don't know what my type is, okay?

246
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:10,885
I mean, I've been dating you
for so long, now...

247
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:15,485
What is happening? Why are you asking me
these questions today?

248
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:20,565
Okay.

249
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:29,285
Today at the off-site,
there was this biker dude.

250
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:32,925
His name was Raunak.

251
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,925
He's known to travel across India, he...

252
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:42,525
He's a travel blogger and a photographer.
I mean...

253
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:47,045
Initially, he came across as
a typical show-off.

254
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:51,525
But then we were talking, and he had these
really interesting stories to tell.

255
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:52,925
Biker dude, no?

256
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:55,525
I mean, he doesn't have a proper job,

257
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:59,085
but he's so sorted.
He likes to plan things.

258
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:05,125
And then somehow we exchanged numbers,
and he just texted me.

259
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,045
You gave him your number?

260
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:09,085
Dhruv, I'm trying to
explain something else.

261
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:11,685
Yeah, Kavya, but...

262
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,165
did you flirt back?

263
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:21,165
-Kavya?
-No. dude.

264
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,525
I mean, no, I...

265
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:26,805
I was just behaving differently.
You know, I...

266
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,605
I was on my best behavior.

267
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:34,605
Yeah. That's what we call flirting.

268
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:36,525
Dhruv, that's not the point.

269
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:38,685
Really?

270
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,245
I told him I have a boyfriend.

271
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:43,285
I told him when he comes to Bombay,
we'll take him around.

272
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,925
What? Motherfucker.

273
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:50,325
Sorry, but, motherfucker.
What is happening?

274
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:53,045
We'll take him around? Come along, dude.

275
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,205
Dhruv, will you calm down?

276
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,965
Yes, okay, now tell me.

277
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,405
Okay, firstly, this is not about him.

278
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,085
-Okay?
-Yeah, okay.

279
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:09,045
It's just that this whole situation
make me feel like...

280
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,765
what is someone is better suited for me,

281
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:17,365
someone else. I mean,
not just me, even you?

282
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,165
Don't you ever think
that someone is better suited for you?

283
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:23,365
Like is this it?
Isn't there someone better--

284
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,365
Yes, I get the point.

285
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:30,925
So you've never thought about this?
Tell me the truth.

286
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,925
To tell you the truth,
I'm thinking about just one thing.

287
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,005
That I woke up in the morning

288
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,645
and bought gram flour for you,

289
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:44,765
got detailed instructions from your mom
and made <i>pithla bhakri</i> for you,

290
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:48,245
and you have been partying with a roadie.

291
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,885
-Why are you laughing, madwoman?
-Roadie?

292
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:54,405
Yes, he's a roadie. Biker.

293
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,445
That's not the point, dude.
It's not about him.

294
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,525
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It's about...

295
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:03,645
It's about making a choice.

296
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:07,085
Like how will we ever know that
this is good enough?

297
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:09,325
There could be someone,
something better.

298
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:12,325
Yeah, obviously.
Obviously there will be something better.

299
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,685
-Yes, then?
-Then...

300
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:16,925
As in then what? Then...

301
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:19,645
Then you will never be happy.

302
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,845
It's not like that, Dhruv.

303
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,045
Working towards my future makes me happy.

304
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,485
Working towards making things better
for us makes me happy.

305
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,605
Yeah, but wait. What's wrong with this?
This is perfect.

306
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,645
See, nothing is wrong with this.

307
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:36,965
This is not about us.
I'm just, in general, saying that...

308
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,765
-I mean, there is a person--
-Yeah.

309
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,565
Trying to make the best out of
what you have

310
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:46,045
is what everything is about.

311
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:48,645
Like, that is the most difficult thing.
Isn't it?

312
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:54,285
I don't know.

313
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:59,925
Okay, seriously, the thought
does cross my mind, too.

314
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:01,965
Even I am human.

315
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:06,845
So when I met that girl in Bombay
who happens to be from Delhi or that side,

316
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:08,805
so there are
common reference points, right?

317
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,885
It's same conversation.
You had dumplings from there?

318
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,405
Did you have street food from there?

319
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,045
And when I'm talking about, dude,

320
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:17,445
the sunshine feels wonderful
when you sit on the roof in the winter.

321
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:19,765
So she gets it. And obviously, right?

322
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:22,925
And just like that, obviously,
there will be guys who are better than me,

323
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,085
better looking than me.
That's bound to happen.

324
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:27,405
But if they make you laugh the way I do,

325
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:30,285
if you open up to them in the way
that you have opened up to me,

326
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:33,725
then I will feel very messed up.

327
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:39,925
I mean, as people, you and I
are pretty ordinary, dude.

328
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:44,565
We are not ultra special.
We are not superstars.

329
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:49,285
But this makes me feel special, dude.
This is good, right?

330
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:52,765
When we're together, it's fun. It's nice.

331
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,645
So, I don't mind being ordinary
because this is nice.

332
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,325
Yes, you know what?

333
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:06,685
It's like Leicester City winning the
Premier League. It's exactly like that.

334
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:08,925
Yes, that's what this is. For sure.

335
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:09,965
-Yeah.
-What?

336
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,085
Sit straight.

337
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:13,165
Yeah, it's like...

338
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:17,845
So, the odds of Leicester City winning
the Premier League were 5000 to 1.

339
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,485
The odds of Mahatma Gandhi being alive
right now are actually more than that.

340
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,085
So how did they win?

341
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,645
Because of chemistry. See.

342
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,525
There are two, three exceptional players,

343
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:32,725
the rest of the team was okay, but they
played well as a unit. Cohesion, yes!

344
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,245
Cohesion is the word
that the coach kept on using.

345
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:37,365
Yeah, they played well as a unit.

346
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,285
And what are we, you and I?

347
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,805
We are also a team.

348
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,325
We will watch <i>Andaz Apna Apna.</i>

349
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,565
On Sunday.

350
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:52,605
Thank you for this.

351
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:55,565
-It was amazing.
-Yeah? It's good, right?

352
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:01,285
Dude, but I feel like eating bebinca.

353
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,245
You know what?

354
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:06,885
I can have two scoops of vanilla ice cream
with bebinca,

355
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:11,965
put some mint leaves and some
Baileys Irish Cream.

356
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:15,405
-Fuck.
-You must, Mr. Man Boobs.

357
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,805
Don't say stuff like that.

358
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:23,605
Actually, fuck it, you can say it.
But, seriously,

359
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:27,045
what if they just stick there
and they continue to grow?

360
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:31,085
-Then what happens?
-I think it will be amazing.

361
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:34,285
-We can go bra shopping--
-Fuck off, dude. Get lost.

362
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:37,805
-What is it?
-Don't worry about yours.

363
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,205
-I'll love them as much as I love you.
-Really?

364
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:46,485
Oh, fuck, what can't I hear him?

365
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:52,125
Where is your roadie?
Roadie, see this, this is love.

366
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,645
-I'm sorry.
-For flirting?

367
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,645
-I didn't--
-Yeah, okay.

368
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,565
What happened? Do you want some?

369
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:25,645
No, Dhruv.
Let's try something new today, okay?

370
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:28,165
Try drinking your green tea
without making that sound.

371
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:31,805
I can do it. But it won't feel as good.

372
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,365
I'm middle class.
I can't do anything.

373
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:44,365
Shall I tell you something?

374
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,365
I did find it a bit weird

375
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,965
when you were talking about that roadie.

376
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:56,605
A little bit. But, yes, dude.
It was weird.

377
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:01,125
Actually...

378
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,565
even I found it weird
to tell you about it.

379
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:07,005
Yeah, I mean...

380
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:09,565
But if I didn't tell you,
it would be unfair.

381
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,845
But the uncomfortable talks
increase the comfort.

382
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:18,965
Yes, it's better to say something
uncomfortable that is bothering us

383
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:20,445
than not to say it at all, right?

384
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:24,325
Jerk, repeating my words to me in English?

385
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,645
What happened to Leicester City
after that season?

386
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:29,965
After that season?

387
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:33,205
They almost got delegated, man.
They played badly.

388
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:35,325
-What?
-Yeah, look at your face.

389
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:37,005
-Seriously?
-Yes.

390
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:40,565
That's another story.
We don't have to worry about that.

391
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:56,325
Dhruv? Will you please get some water?

392
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:58,605
-Get lost.
-I'm thirsty.

393
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:00,445
-You get it.
-But I'm tired.

394
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,565
-So even I am tired.
-Please.

395
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:04,165
Just go and get it, dude.

396
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:08,605
-Damn. Just because of your <i>pithla bhakri.</i>
-At least it was of some use.

397
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:13,525
Listen. Get me a bottle of water as well.

398
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,925
Thirst is very contagious at night.

399
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:18,445
-If one gets thirsty, so does the other.
-You talk too much.

400
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:22,045
The light switch is outside.
Why are you back?

401
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:23,365
I'm back now!

402
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:25,885
-What is this?
-You go!

403
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:28,005
What do you mean, "you go"?
You were right there!

404
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,245
