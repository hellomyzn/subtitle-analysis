1
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:22,805
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Please continue.

2
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:05,205
Next to the medical store.
The medical store.

3
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:07,805
It's Axis Bank that's there, not ICICI.

4
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:09,885
Please, follow the location.

5
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,085
Okay, anyways, let's brainstorm
when we meet next.

6
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,965
Sure. Next week?

7
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,365
No, I'm afraid that's too far out.
Let's meet day after.

8
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:23,725
Day after would be too early for us.
I don't think we will be able to...

9
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:26,365
I understand, but we really need
to get something soon.

10
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:29,765
Anyway, other designers we spoke to
highly recommended you, so you know...

11
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:34,165
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
We'll try and manage something.

12
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:37,285
I'm sure you will. Bye. See you.
Looking forward to it. Bye.

13
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,965
You wait there and I'll walk there.

14
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,885
Let's go. We have to walk for a bit.

15
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,765
-You should have called him here.
-I tried, dude.

16
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,165
-Today we have to work a bit longer.
-Why?

17
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,365
-We're presenting to them tomorrow.
-What? No!

18
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,805
-I'll just take a little bit.
-Yes, it's done.

19
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,965
-This is very tasty.
-What did you bring?

20
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,645
Tuna sandwich. You want a bite?

21
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:09,845
-What?
-Tuna.

22
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:14,005
Yuck, fish! How did you get it
in your bag? Doesn't it stink?

23
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,085
Stink? Tuna smells just like
your mashed vegetables.

24
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:22,045
-Do mashed vegetables smell?
-No, no. Sir, I'm giving an example.

25
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,725
Man, let me listen. You made me miss yoga!

26
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:27,405
How do we go back?
And what was he saying?

27
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:40,365
I saw it right away. You are from Delhi.
From where in Delhi, man?

28
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:42,125
-Rohini, dude.
-What are you saying?

29
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,885
-You, too? Wow.
-And this station, Kaushambi.

30
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,405
-This too falls in Delhi. NCR.
-Yes, bro.

31
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:53,245
This man, he can't digest his food
till he cracks the same joke 100 times.

32
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,805
After teaching, I need to do something.

33
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,765
Do you want me to teach the whole day?

34
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:58,445
A guy needs to breathe.

35
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:02,605
Why are you here? For the money?

36
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:05,165
Yes. No. I mean...

37
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,965
Yes, man, for the money.

38
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:15,045
What happened is I quit my job.

39
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:19,045
There is pressure at home.
I've already taken a loan, so...

40
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:21,445
I thought I'd try it out.

41
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:24,085
Whatever helps. You know, why not?

42
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,525
Like that.

43
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:29,845
You mean, like that?

44
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,325
-What?
-Yes, I mean,

45
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:35,725
he's from our area, we can tell him,
there is no problem.

46
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:39,405
-What happened?
-Bro, I'll sort our your money problem.

47
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:42,125
-Have you heard of IOS?
-Indian Open School.

48
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,005
Wow. You're both smart.

49
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,245
Here's the deal, they get students

50
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:48,805
who don't want to answer exams,
but want the degree.

51
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:50,205
Like <i>Munna Bhai.</i>

52
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,285
-You've seen <i>Munna Bhai,</i> right?
-Yes, I have.

53
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,525
But what are you guys trying to say?

54
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:57,565
-Institutes like ours have teachers.
-Yes.

55
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,965
But they answer the exams
for such students.

56
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,045
And these students give money in return.

57
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,845
And some students are so good,
they give 30, 000 to 40,000.

58
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:07,765
30,000 to 40,000? Motherfucker!

59
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:09,605
-No, what?
-Our Delhi boy.

60
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:13,525
No, no. Three...
30,000 to 40,000 for one exam?

61
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:16,445
Bro, 30,000 to 40,000 is
minimum guaranteed, did you know that?

62
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:19,245
Usually it's more than that.
And if you know someone

63
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:24,405
and recommend him to answer an exam,
you get an extra 15% as commission.

64
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,005
But, wait. So...

65
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:31,205
-How does it work out?
-Bro, it's not work.

66
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:34,405
There are Whatsapp groups
with IIT and BITS students.

67
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:37,845
The client sends a message.
And after that you go there.

68
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,325
-All right.
-Like we did.

69
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,165
Was it Bangalore? We went to Bangalore.

70
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,245
It's a lot of fun. It's very high.

71
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,525
Think about it carefully
and then let us know.

72
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:47,445
Yes, but...

73
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,725
-is it safe?
-Motherfucker, it's totally safe.

74
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,165
There's no problem at all.

75
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,525
You don't have to do anything.

76
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:55,485
You show up,
answer the exam for two hours,

77
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:57,565
-and leave.
-And let me tell you,

78
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,085
there are very few seats.

79
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:02,565
Forget about your commission,
I won't even get mine. Okay? Come.

80
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:04,485
-Okay?
-You guys go. My class is over.

81
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,365
-Okay. Let's go. All right.
-Let's go.

82
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,445
How much do you want?

83
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:09,805
What do you mean? We get equal shares.

84
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,645
This is not how it's done.

85
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:32,685
No, dude, Kavya. It doesn't work this way.

86
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,485
-Dude, this is not going to happen.
-Guys, relax.

87
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:38,005
We'll try. If it doesn't happen,
it doesn't happen. It's fine.

88
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:41,685
-Why is this necessary.
-Dude, it's a really big client, okay?

89
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,805
They are trying to open
ten co-working spaces

90
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,885
in the next two years. Just imagine.

91
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:49,245
-I got you guys donuts.
-Donuts?

92
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,365
But what about lunch?

93
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:52,845
-Lunch?
-Yeah.

94
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,845
Dude, will you say something?

95
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,605
I don't mind chicken club sandwich
with peach iced tea.

96
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:59,685
Yeah. Kavya, what is your budget?

97
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:01,845
Okay.

98
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:30,245
-Hero, come here.
-Yes.

99
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:39,045
-You didn't know?
-No.

100
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,645
I thought bonsai was a plant
like other plants.

101
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:47,485
Bonsai can be made out of the seeds
of real trees.

102
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:49,925
-Any tree?
-Any tree.

103
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:51,605
Okay.

104
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:56,165
Bonsai literally means
"to plant in a container."

105
00:06:56,885 --> 00:07:00,565
And it's meant to focus on inner harmony.

106
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:02,165
Do you understand?

107
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:08,005
And it helps to grow.
Exercise the idea of effort.

108
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,965
And that you forget.

109
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:19,165
One second, sir.

110
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:21,925
-This phone will destroy you.
-Yes, Mom.

111
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:27,405
You didn't get it? Why?

112
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,085
No, I sent it last night.

113
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,165
Yes, I sent it via IMPS.

114
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:39,565
Did you check it on the app
or on the website?

115
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:43,445
No, don't go to the bank.
I'll go home and check again.

116
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:45,285
Yes, I'll do it.

117
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,045
Who did you take the loan from?

118
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:56,085
So it's okay, it's uncle. It's family.
We can pay later.

119
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,445
Why does it have to be right away?

120
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,405
It's not like we'll run away.

121
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,925
Okay, Mom, I'll go home and do it.

122
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:08,965
Yes, I'll send that as well.
And check the old one, too.

123
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,405
No, don't say sorry. Stay chill.

124
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:15,525
Relax. We'll do something.
We'll make it happen. Don't worry.

125
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:21,725
From Aakash? I don't know.
He's getting married.

126
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:25,965
Okay, I'll ask him.

127
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:28,805
All right.

128
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,765
Yes, everything is good. All right.

129
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,285
What did I have for lunch?
I had a tuna sandwich.

130
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:43,605
Tuna, Mom.

131
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:47,925
Tuna, Mom, tuna! I'm not shouting.

132
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,965
You couldn't hear me.

133
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,725
Yes. Sorry.

134
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:55,725
Do you want to learn?

135
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:59,085
I mean, do you want
to make your own bonsai?

136
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:02,525
I want to.

137
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:05,605
Roughly, it will cost 3,000.

138
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,845
I'll get all the raw materials:
soil and magic dust.

139
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,725
Do you want it right away?

140
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:17,125
No, whenever... I'm going to the nursery
tomorrow, so I thought...

141
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,205
Okay. But don't do it now.
We'll do it later.

142
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:22,805
All right.

143
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:25,365
-You let me know.
-Yes.

144
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,205
How's the hibiscus?

145
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:30,725
It's all right.

146
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:46,285
Why do I feel like I've seen this before?

147
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,485
-Because you have.
-As in?

148
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:53,805
We created this presentation before,
we just replaced the images.

149
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,765
-Long live copy and paste.
-Guys, you can't do that.

150
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,685
But there is no time, Kavya.

151
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,925
Of course there is time, dude.

152
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:02,725
-The client doesn't even care, dude.
-Obviously they do care.

153
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,325
And irrespective of that,
it's our responsibility to--

154
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,005
Kavya, there is no time to do this.

155
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:12,245
Guys, it's 2:00 right now, okay?
You have four more hours.

156
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:16,085
This will take you ten minutes to redo.
You have to redo this.

157
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,925
Guys, finish it.

158
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:26,445
Dude, am I saying something wrong?

159
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,605
No, you are just being too ambitious.

160
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,365
And that's a bad thing?

161
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,765
It's not. People are used to
taking short-cuts.

162
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:38,605
When someone doesn't let them do that,
they just start hating that person.

163
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,005
But...

164
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:44,445
I bet they made a group on Whatsapp
and must be bitching.

165
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:46,885
Shall I check?

166
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:27,485
-Is all this normal?
<i>-Yes, dude, it's totally normal.</i>

167
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:31,045
-And they never caught you?
<i>-Are you crazy?</i>

168
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:34,205
<i>-Remember where the last Dhanno came from?</i>
-What?

169
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:37,645
-Money for the Enfield came from there?
<i>-Of course.</i>

170
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:41,445
-That's great.
<i>-You tell me. How's your job going?</i>

171
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:46,365
The job is fine.
The students are very intelligent.

172
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,525
I'm the one who freaks out.

173
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,045
Dude, Aakash, tell me something--

174
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,125
<i>Listen to me. Never get married.</i>

175
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:56,565
Yes. What? Why? What happened?

176
00:11:56,965 --> 00:12:00,005
<i>Everything is so expensive.</i>
<i>And you are already broke.</i>

177
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:04,485
<i>Tell me,</i>
<i>you are coming for the wedding, right?</i>

178
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,685
Yes, I'm coming.

179
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,925
<i>-And you're bringing Kavya, right?</i>
-Yes, she'll come as well.

180
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,045
<i>Okay. That's great. See you.</i>

181
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,325
-Okay then.
<i>-Okay, bye.</i>

182
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:37,245
DHRUV: AT LEAST, SAY GOOD LUCK
SUPER NERVOUS

183
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:07,445
What the fuck!

184
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,605
It's not that big a deal, man.

185
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,005
Of course, it's a big deal!

186
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:12,925
How could you send the wrong pricing
to Yohan? You should have checked!

187
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,485
It's just the price of one bulb.

188
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:18,125
Yes, but that one bulb is going to be
used in 20 different places, Rohan!

189
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,405
The difference is going to be significant
and you know that.

190
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:23,325
It's not the final presentation. We are
still working. Will be done by tomorrow.

191
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:26,725
Not tomorrow. Today.
We are not leaving until this is fixed.

192
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,845
When did you get home?

193
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:42,685
Tired?

194
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:50,045
You look tired. Like a tired monkey.

195
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,565
I look ugly as fuck.

196
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:57,245
Like a tired ugly ass fuck monkey.

197
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,165
Long day?

198
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:05,885
Long, tiring, frustrating.

199
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,205
-Shall I warm up the pasta?
-I ate it.

200
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,565
-You ate it cold again?
-I was tired.

201
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,925
You should have woken me up, dude.

202
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,725
You were sleeping so nicely.

203
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:24,445
So what?

204
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,365
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

205
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:36,125
Let's go to sleep, Dhruv.
I have to reach early tomorrow.

206
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:41,925
What time is it?

207
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,245
What? It's 1:45.

208
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:53,645
You returned so late. What were you
doing in the office? Did you eat there?

209
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:49,005
-Sister, where is Kavya?
-She must be in the other room.

210
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,365
Give me something.

211
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:58,925
You're crazy. Go now.

212
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,565
-What was that?
-Joke.

213
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,365
How come you were listening
to one of his jokes?

214
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:08,685
Because he was upset.

215
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:09,805
About what?

216
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,085
Sorry. Don't tell mother.

217
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,085
-Sister? Take the almonds.
-Yes?

218
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,925
I already had some, Lata.
Those are for Dhruv.

219
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:36,325
Why does brother...

220
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,885
What were you doing?

221
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,445
I need money.

222
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:42,205
You need money?

223
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:50,085
-Don't forget to take your lunch box.
-Okay.

224
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:54,165
-And bring back the other one.
-Yes, for sure. Promise.

225
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:57,845
Why do you need money?

226
00:17:58,365 --> 00:17:59,485
Mobile.

227
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,485
You want a mobile?

228
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:04,805
-Why?
-To play.

229
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:10,925
How much money will you get like this?

230
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:15,365
I won't tell your mom.

231
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,325
But will you listen to me?

232
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:22,765
You can get a phone like this,
but it won't be your phone.

233
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:24,325
Right?

234
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:28,005
Work hard. Study a lot.

235
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:29,845
Get good grades.

236
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:32,765
Then Sister Lata and I
will gift you a phone ourselves.

237
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:35,085
Then you'll be able to enjoy it.

238
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:38,245
You'll be able to play a lot,
because it will be your phone.

239
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:39,805
All right?

240
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,845
Stealing things doesn't make them ours.

241
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:46,325
Hard work makes them ours.

242
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,445
Will you remember this?
And don't do this again, all right?

243
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:53,885
For a week now, I've been noticing
that money goes missing from my wallet.

244
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:54,965
First, I thought it was you.

245
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:57,045
But then I thought and,

246
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,325
you know, maybe I wasn't careful
with my calculations or something.

247
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,125
Today I saw him.

248
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:04,485
-Poor thing.
-Shit, man.

249
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,285
Dhruv, it's so sad.
He was so scared when I saw him.

250
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:10,005
So, I asked him to tell me a joke.

251
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,045
He was saying something.
He looked so cute.

252
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,925
He was crying and telling me.

253
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,525
The elephant lost his shorts,
so he went to the river bank

254
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:21,965
to find the, ant and then I don't know
what happened. But some bell rang.

255
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:23,405
Anyway, you ask him.

256
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:26,685
And, listen, be normal with him, okay?

257
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:38,645
Aren't you late?

258
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:42,485
I am. But I informed them.
This was important, right?

259
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,965
-Okay, I'll leave.
-You kept the nutribar?

260
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:48,445
-I did. Get the shower fixed, okay?
-Yes, for sure.

261
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,485
Okay, bye.

262
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:50,765
Thanks.

263
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:53,645
Okay.

264
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,645
It's game night at Sushmita's.
You want to go tonight?

265
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:59,685
Yes, we'll see.
We'll go, if we feel like it.

266
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,805
Or we can just stay at home
and watch a film.

267
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:03,805
Cool. We'll figure it out. Bye.

268
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:04,925
Yeah. Bye.

269
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,365
EXIT "WE SHALL OVERCOME" GROUP?

270
