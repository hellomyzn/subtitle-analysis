1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,320
Kavu. Kavu.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,680
Please get up and close the door,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,560
-I have to go.
-Don't go!

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,960
-Come here.
-Kavu, please get up.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,920
I need to eat those <i>bhajjis.</i>
Please get up, Kavu.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,880
-Okay, okay.
-Please get up, get up.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,680
Okay, wear your shoes, I'll just get up,
but you come here for two minutes.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,080
Momo, wait! I'll also come.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,000
You have 90 seconds. Hurry up.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,240
-You called the cab over here?
-No cab today.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
-You bought a car?
-Obviously.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,840
We're going to eat <i>bhajjis.</i>
It's not like we'll take the train.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,040
-Be serious.
-It's Aakash's brother's car.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,320
I borrowed it for a day.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,840
Come, it'll be a nice drive.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,040
Yeah! I can sleep now.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,440
Seriously?

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,360
Sir, do you know if there's a lady
that sells <i>bhajjis </i>out here?

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
She sits a little ahead.

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
-How far?
-Just a little further down.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,520
-You sure?
-Yeah, sure.

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,920
Fuck this, man.

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,440
Well, thank you.

24
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,320
What's the scene?

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,640
She hasn't come since the past few days.

26
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
Why?

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
'Cause her son had a baby,
so she had to go to the village.

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
Damn it, man.

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,240
I can't even be angry at this.
Let's go back.

30
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Back?

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,720
Dhruv, we've come all the way here
and look at the view!

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
How can we just go back?

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,200
Are you allergic
to pure oxygen or something?

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
Oxygen.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,640
I'm taking it to go.
You should get some, too.

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,600
Come on, let's go back, man.

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,480
Dude, is that a vineyard?

38
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,560
-So?
-So, let's go!

39
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,600
{\an8}Kavu, let's go.
We'll get in a mess unnecessarily.

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm sure this qualifies as trespassing.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,720
Hey, relax. It's exciting!

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,640
No, Kavu, let's go back, man.

43
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,680
Hey, but it's not like we're doing
anything to these grapes.

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,320
-Dude, look!
-No, dude, don't.

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,760
No, don't do that, man.

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
No, Kavu! What is this?

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,480
Interesting.

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,440
I think they make Chardonnay out of these.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,040
-Yeah?
-You wanna eat?

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
Eat.

51
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,200
Dude, stop being on your phone.

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm checking to see if Sturridge
is fit to play or not.

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,680
At least don't do it here, no?
It's criminal.

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,080
Kavya, you know this place
is just two hours away from Bombay,

55
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,480
and you can come here
any time of the week that you want to,

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,040
but, yeah, you are a sloth bear,
so hence, things like these--

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Shut up.

58
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,200
It's very difficult
to be in my shoes, okay?

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
I love my sleep. You don't know how--

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,640
Excuse me, sir. Have you come from Bombay?

61
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,920
Yeah, I'm sorry, man. We were just--

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
Your group's wine tasting session
is about to begin.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,800
You can join the rest of them
at the wine cellar in the basement, sir.

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,640
We're not with the group though,
but how much is it for?

65
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,680
-It's for 250 rupees.
-Cool.

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,680
Actually, if you have the Little App,
you can do it for 200 rupees.

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,960
-Yeah, even better.
-Let's go.

68
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,920
So, wine tasting is all about three S's.

69
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,600
Smell, swirl, and sip.

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,840
Now, in the first step,

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,280
actually try to put your nose
into the glass and smell the wine.

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,080
Now, this particular wine
is called a rosé,

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
and the salmon pink color

74
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
is because of the pressure that we put
on the seed, the juice, and the skin.

75
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,520
In the second step, the swirl,
move your glass like this.

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,840
In this, we give the wine some oxygen
to open up and breathe.

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,520
Now smell the wine again.
You may notice some difference.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,360
It might smell a bit different.

79
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,480
-It smells much sweeter.
-Yes, it is, sir.

80
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,680
-Cheers.
-Yeah, it does.

81
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,360
Now in the third step, the sip,

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
actually try taking the sip of wine

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,840
and try to gargle it in your mouth,
like this:

84
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
This process is called aeration.

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
In this, we provide the wine
with more oxygen to breathe.

86
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,880
You're so happy you're getting
to do this in public.

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
What is this?

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,080
Sir, don't worry.
I'll get you a napkin, sir.

89
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
This is no way to behave! Be serious!

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,280
Wine tasting is an art
to be savored drop by drop,

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,520
bit by bit, sip by sip.

93
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,560
I can't believe we came here
to eat <i>bhajjis.</i>

94
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,040
By the way, that handloom exhibition's
happening today.

95
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,760
Remember to message auntie.

96
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,280
You message her?

97
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,360
Then don't get pissed off
when I take out my phone.

98
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
So funny.

99
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,440
Dhruv.

100
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,960
I've been thinking. Should I quit my job?

101
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,000
What?

102
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,360
Careful.

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,400
-Are you drunk?
-Yeah.

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,320
No, I've just not been enjoying it
for a while now.

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,680
I know. I could see that.

106
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Why didn't you tell me?

107
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,480
Because I knew you would say it yourself,
and you did.

108
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,080
In fact, consumer studies...
this theory called revealed preferences.

109
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
It basically means your actions reveal
what you want.

110
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
How cool is that?

111
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
But it's scary, no?

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,760
What if I quit my job
and never figure out what I wanna do?

113
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,160
Okay, so let's assume you quit your job.

114
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,600
And say there's a 50 percent chance
that when you quit--

115
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
No, Dhruv.
Please don't talk in terms of probability.

116
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,920
Just talk simply.

117
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,560
If you quit to figure out
what you want to do,

118
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
then it's not a waste of time. Simple.

119
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
Pros and cons.
Yes, let's do pros and cons.

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,760
Let's be a little serious.

121
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,680
Pros first or cons?

122
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,520
-Cons.
-Okay.

123
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,960
So, you won't be earning anything.

124
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,080
You may run out of your savings.

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
Your parents may not understand
your decision at first.

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,120
Everybody around you
would be getting richer.

127
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Some lifestyle changes,
even though I'm there, but still.

128
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,280
It may not look good on your CV.

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,200
It could take a while
before you find your next job.

130
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,640
You could just be more confused
after this.

131
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,480
Okay, that's enough. That's enough.

132
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,760
Pros now.

133
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,360
Pros, pros, pros.

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,240
Hey!

135
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm thinking.

136
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
It takes time.

137
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,320
Yeah. The break may help you realize

138
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,800
whether you want to continue
working in sales

139
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,280
or some other department...

140
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,160
Or just-- Just explore
a totally different career path.

141
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,720
Like becoming a dog babysitter.

142
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,080
-How cool is that?
-That is actually cool.

143
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,680
-And it's a thing, you know? Dogsitter.
-Dogsitter.

144
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,240
Anyway, focus. Okay.

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,360
So, yeah, you could travel.
You could read more.

146
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,160
You could paint more. You could draw more.

147
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,920
You can just explore yourself, you know?
Just do new things. Grow.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,360
-Now you're just repeating yourself.
-You figured it out.

149
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,000
Anyway, so there are more cons than pros.

150
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Yeah, but I like the pros better.

151
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
I think I'm seriously
gonna think about it.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,400
So, it's true, huh?

153
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
When you come to a place like this,
with good pure oxygen,

154
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
it really cleanses your mind.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
You get clarity.

156
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm taking credit for all of this,
by the way.

157
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,520
Really?
You wanted to go back two hours ago.

158
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
-Yeah, but--
-And I spotted this place.

159
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,040
But we came here because of me.

160
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not about this place, anyway.

161
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,920
I was fine until I saw that video
you shared on Facebook about that girl.

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
-Which one?
-The Bangalore girl.

163
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
-The poem, right?
-Yeah.

164
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,560
About what it feels like
to be an introvert,

165
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,160
and it's not because I am
an introvert or anything.

166
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,600
It's just that I really like the way
she expressed herself, you know?

167
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,040
I wonder if I have ever expressed myself
so well.

168
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,720
You must have.

169
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,360
I don't know.

170
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,800
Maybe I did when I was a kid.
It all reduced when I grew up.

171
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,200
I used to concentrate so much
when I used to paint.

172
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
I used to be really active in school,
you know?

173
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,520
Debate clubs and cultural events.

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,960
I used to be on the top of my game
all the time.

175
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,920
I really enjoyed being busy and tired.

176
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,400
You know, I thought, when I'd grow up,
I'll do something kick-ass.

177
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,920
I've not done anything of that sort yet.

178
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,800
And I loved surprising myself.

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,520
I don't remember
the last time that it's happened.

180
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,040
I think I have just become very...
you know, comfortable.

181
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,960
-Very--
-Lazy?

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,400
Not lazy.

183
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,400
Fine. Lazy.

184
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,640
I hate that word...

185
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,240
and I've not only become lazy physically,
but mentally, also.

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Don't take this in the wrong way,
but... most of the things that we do

187
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,880
are the things that you want to do.

188
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,520
-What?
-And I love doing them,

189
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
but it's just that, honestly,
it takes more effort from my side

190
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,440
to travel two hours
to eat some <i>bhajjis </i>or cutlets--

191
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
What? Wait.

192
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,360
So you're not here to have some <i>bhajjis?</i>

193
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,920
-Of course not.
-Hey.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,680
I came here for us.

195
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,400
We've not been out of the city
for a long time,

196
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,560
and... there's another reason
which I'll tell you about later.

197
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,600
Well, okay.
At least you're thinking about all this.

198
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,880
You just have to figure out
a few things and...

199
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
This is good.
This is a step in the right direction.

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,280
Sounding very formal right now.

201
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,040
Yeah, because I'm being serious.

202
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,240
Like serious, like, you know?

203
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,200
-Serious, like serious!
-Yeah, yeah, got it.

204
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,640
I'll seriously think about it.

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,440
You didn't feel bad
about what I said, right?

206
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,720
Are you crazy?

207
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,040
So nice you're opening up and talking
about things that you're feeling.

208
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,520
It's good. See, all this is nice.

209
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,760
Every time we go out, we have fun.
We should just do this more often.

210
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,680
I know.

211
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,280
It's funny how so many girls my age
are busy getting married and traveling

212
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,800
and doing so well in their careers,

213
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,400
and here I am planning to quit my job
and start something completely new.

214
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,600
I don't even know what.

215
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
You're just figuring out how to make
your everyday life more fun and better.

216
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,880
Not many people think like that,
Kavya Kulkarni, so this is nice.

217
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,000
-Chill.
-That's true.

218
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,040
And dog babysitter
is actually a good plan.

219
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,200
Dogsitter. What's dog babysitter?

220
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,600
Yeah, same thing.

221
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,480
Now say,

222
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,680
"Thank you, Dhanush."

223
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,840
Thank you, Dhruv.

224
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,520
Wow, manners! Where did that come from?

225
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,080
That's because
I'm feeling really light right now.

226
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,360
I don't want to go back to Mumbai.

227
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,640
Like, seriously.

228
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,320
You mean, "Seriously!"

229
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,560
I didn't come here for you, silly.

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,720
I came here because...

231
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,280
Do you see that?

232
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,560
Pretty, dude. Looking nice.

233
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
You don't remember, do you?

234
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,160
Exactly two years ago
is when we met for the first time.

235
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
No.

236
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,520
Let me check. I don't think it's today.

237
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,120
I think it's tomorrow. See? It's tomorrow.

238
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,640
It's today. You want to bet?

239
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,920
No, I have the tickets. Let's do this.

240
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,680
Loser.

241
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
-It's today.
-Right.

242
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,600
When did you change my status to,

243
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,160
"Girls, be careful. The Don is here"?

244
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,320
When you were having a shower.

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
-Which one's mine?
-Here.

246
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,560
Take either one.

247
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,600
I told you to make mine
with more milk and less sugar, no?

248
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,800
Which one are you reading?

249
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,160
This is the one with...

250
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
Just stop here for a second.

251
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,600
-Hey, you want to take this one?
-No, thanks.

252
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,560
Are you sure? I can take another one.

253
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,720
Okay.

254
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,240
-Hey, where are you headed?
-Powai.

255
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,880
Cool, I'm going there, too.
Let me drop you.

256
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,360
-Sure?
-Yeah.

257
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,400
-Can I please use your bathroom?
-What?

258
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,840
I have lizards in mine
and I'm really scared of them.

259
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,520
Hey, what? I can't use
a nice-smelling fruity shower gel?

260
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,520
No, of course. Of course you can.

261
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,880
Do you want some green tea?
I make really nice green tea.

262
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,360
Sure.
