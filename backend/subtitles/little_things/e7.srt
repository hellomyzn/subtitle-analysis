1
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,685
Kavya, what are you doing?

2
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:18,085
Just finishing some work, Dhruv.
Go to sleep.

3
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,605
You sleep as well.
We have to be up in a few hours.

4
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:31,805
Kavya?

5
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:34,925
Sleep, no?

6
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,165
Just give me two minutes, Dhruv.

7
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,205
-Come, Dhruv, we're late.
-Dude.

8
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,005
-Thank you, Madam.
-You're welcome.

9
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,085
Shall we take the bags?

10
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,685
How is it that your bag
is heavier than mine?

11
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,085
-How is it heavier? It's the same.
-Exactly.

12
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:50,045
-Are you wearing a lehenga as well?
-No.

13
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,285
I couldn't decide which suit to wear,
so I'm taking both both.

14
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:55,325
Two suits, two shirts, two pants,

15
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,445
two ties, two shoes. Two of everything.

16
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:59,405
For two days? You are ridiculous.

17
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,365
Yes. Did you take medicine?

18
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:09,805
Wow. Damn nice room, dude?

19
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:12,605
-Yeah.
-Aakash has made it in life.

20
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,085
He's having fun.

21
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:18,565
What is the Wi-Fi password?

22
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,285
Guess what? Tub bath, bitches!

23
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:24,765
-Bathtub, Dhruv.
-That's what I meant.

24
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:29,885
Fuck, did you get hurt?
Sorry, I was aiming for that corner.

25
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:33,125
You're okay? Now move away
or the next one will hit you.

26
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,605
Dhruv, how do I connect to the Wi-Fi?

27
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,485
-Forget about work. Okay, show me--
-No, wait, I'm figuring it out.

28
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:43,565
Fuck, dude.
This is how weddings should be.

29
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,725
A holiday along with the wedding.
Fun for the guests, right?

30
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:51,485
-Hotels beds are so comfy, right? So soft.
-I swear.

31
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:54,605
And it smells so good here.

32
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:57,965
Yep. Wait. What did you say?

33
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:01,325
Soft and comfy!

34
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,245
And creepy.

35
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,365
-What is this?
-Show me.

36
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:08,445
"Welcome to Nandini and Aakash's wedding.

37
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,005
We're super excited
to have you present at our wedding.

38
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,045
It's going to be nuts.
Below is the schedule.

39
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,525
Please make sure you're there on time.
Music and Henna at 12 a.m.

40
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,045
Pool party 3 p.m.

41
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,805
-Cocktail party 8 p.m."
-What time is it now?

42
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:25,005
-It's 11:53.
-Dude, what the fuck?

43
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:28,445
-But when was the wedding?
-That's tomorrow in the court.

44
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,165
We have just seven minutes to chill.

45
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:33,605
I know.

46
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:35,765
Why are weddings so hectic?
Why aren't they chill?

47
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:38,045
They should be chill, right?
Like a holiday.

48
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,205
-Anyway, I'm going to go to the loo.
-No, I'm going. Shotgun!

49
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:44,085
-What? I said it first.
-Yeah. But I said shotgun first.

50
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,925
-Who says that anymore?
-I said it.

51
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,925
-It's not valid.
-Yes, it's always valid.

52
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:55,125
Dhruv, help me with the Wi-Fi, dude.

53
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:56,725
I'm in the loo, dude.

54
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:57,805
Please!

55
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,285
Some kids just have a mature face, no?

56
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:36,005
As if they have come in this world
to hate on everyone.

57
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:38,485
-Who are you talking about?
-That kid over there.

58
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,045
Fuck, what happened to him?
Why is he so serious?

59
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:47,405
I think he is thinking
about his father's inheritance.

60
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:49,125
Yeah. No. He's thinking about...

61
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,925
Maybe he is thinking of coming out
in front of his parents.

62
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,845
No, no. Maybe he is thinking of
his dead sibling.

63
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:58,925
What? Are you crazy?

64
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:02,845
Why are you saying such things?
It's a wedding. Look at that.

65
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:07,885
Maybe he is thinking
when will Dhruv and Kavya get married.

66
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:10,125
Interesting.

67
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:13,925
Maybe he is thinking Dhruv and Kavya
are fine they are now.

68
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,805
Son, where is Mom? She's still not here.

69
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:23,765
Mom is still in the loo.
Dad, I controlled myself.

70
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,405
I pushed it back inside.

71
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:28,205
Wow, my son is so smart. Come along.

72
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:32,005
-Pushed it back inside.
-Potty it was.

73
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:33,325
Potty it was.

74
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,725
-I feel like I have to poop.
-Stop it, dude.

75
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,325
Is that why you look so constipated?

76
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,885
I've been smiling at everyone
since this morning.

77
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,245
My mouth is stuck like this.

78
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,925
-The setup is really nice.
-Isn't it?

79
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:46,045
-It's been done by the Wedding Brigade.
-Nice, dude, very nice.

80
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,165
They were right here.
I'll send you the link.

81
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,005
You guys can check it out too.

82
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,525
Guys, shall we get our picture taken?
The line is getting longer.

83
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,605
-Yes.
-Yes. Come on, let's smile.

84
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,445
You don't have to smile for this picture.

85
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,125
Yes, actually, let's not.
At least the photo will be realistic.

86
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,085
Okay.

87
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:12,005
This is very annoying.
The black one was all right.

88
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,765
Just one more day, Dhruv.

89
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:16,605
-Take this.
-Thanks.

90
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,205
Shit, I forgot to get the green chutney.

91
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:21,845
-Should I get it?
-No, it's okay.

92
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,245
It's very crowded.
Look at the line over there.

93
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,565
That could mean anything.

94
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,445
You could be talking about food.
About anything.

95
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:33,685
-Really?
-Yes.

96
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,765
-Look at this.
-Dude, this is fucked up!

97
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:40,285
-It looks scary.
-Was she a bat?

98
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,645
That's what! So I was on top of her,

99
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,485
and she was like,
"Choke me, choke me!"

100
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,525
It was like being part of
a porn film, dude.

101
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:50,765
I'm so glad that something exciting
happened in my life.

102
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,925
Otherwise, it's the same old thing.

103
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,005
This is spicy.

104
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:55,845
I agree with you.

105
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,125
-When I was with Ray--
-Who is Ray?

106
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,045
That 48-years-old ancient dude.

107
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:02,925
-The one with eight girlfriends.
-Yes, that one.

108
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,085
Did you know she met his kids?

109
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:08,685
It's okay, dude.
I mean, he was honest with me, right?

110
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:10,085
It's not like he was lying to me.

111
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:12,565
He respected me, he treated me well.

112
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:17,005
And on the surface, it was weird.
But he was always there for me.

113
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,965
-Dude, she must have been into BDSM.
-Who?

114
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:25,645
Her. The mosquito. The bat woman.
Look at this.

115
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,205
Just think about
what Bombay BDSM must be like.

116
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,765
Under blue plastic sheets.

117
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,885
Plastic sheets sex, bro!

118
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:45,045
Thank you.

119
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:50,685
Do you want more?

120
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:55,005
Do you want the water? Why?
What are you thinking?

121
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:59,805
Nothing. What are you thinking?

122
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,325
I'm just really tired. I think
I'm going to go upstairs and sleep.

123
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:08,725
Dhruv, just one second.

124
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:14,965
I'll just call you back in a minute.

125
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,165
Dhruv, can you please hurry up?

126
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,205
What happened?

127
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:30,485
-Nothing. Just hurry up.
-Am I hurting you?

128
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:33,285
No, I just need to finish some work.

129
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:43,925
Seriously?

130
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,125
What happened?

131
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,405
What the fuck do you mean what happened?

132
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:50,925
-Why would you say that?
-Say what?

133
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,885
The hurry up! And, you know,
the work thing. Why would you say that?

134
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,565
Because the work thing was on my mind,
and you were not hurrying up.

135
00:09:58,805 --> 00:09:59,645
Hurrying up?

136
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:03,005
What are you saying?
At least think about what you are saying.

137
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,525
What is the matter?
Why are you overreacting?

138
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,805
Am I overreacting?

139
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:09,205
Dude, we're trying to have sex here
and this is what you say?

140
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:12,325
"Dhruv, hurry up,"
and you had this pissed off face.

141
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,725
-I wasn't pissed off.
-You should have seen yourself.

142
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:18,125
You could have said the same thing
with love, nicely, with respect.

143
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:19,525
Why say it with irritation?

144
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:22,605
You really made me feel as if I am...

145
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,165
As if I'm forcing you
to have sex with me, man.

146
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,645
-What the--
-No, I mean it.

147
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,325
It's not a nice feeling.
Don't do that again.

148
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,645
Fine, I'm sorry.
But the work thing was really--

149
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:35,325
Stop this work thing. Work, work, work!
Don't talk about it!

150
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:38,165
-I'm sick and tired of this shit.
-Sick of what? Me working?

151
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:40,085
No! Are you deaf?

152
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:42,005
Will you stop talking to me like that?

153
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:44,525
You're making me feel guilty

154
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:45,845
-for wanting to work hard.
-What?

155
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:47,885
I'm making you feel guilty?

156
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:50,565
What is going on, Kavya?
Why are you talking like this?

157
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,445
Work as much as you want to, man.

158
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,485
Really. Work as much as you want to.

159
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,485
I'm there to support you.
Be happy for you.

160
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:02,405
All I'm saying is
that when we are together,

161
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:03,845
that when we have our little world,

162
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:07,925
don't bring anything else in.
Let this be our special place.

163
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,925
Why is the world coming between us, man?

164
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,565
Keep the two apart.

165
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:21,365
Look at everyone else, dude.

166
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:23,885
Everyone is having so much fun.

167
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:27,565
We couldn't even have sex!

168
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,685
Why are you comparing yourself
with others?

169
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,645
I thought you were happy
with what we have.

170
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:37,725
Maybe I'm not, dude.

171
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,765
Okay. Okay. So so let's talk about it.

172
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:43,965
-No, fuck, it.
-No, tell me.

173
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:46,285
When did I not care? When wasn't I there?

174
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,565
No, Dhruv,
you have to talk to me right now!

175
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,045
Okay, you know what? Fuck it.

176
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,045
Dude, I bought a bird-feeder.

177
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,605
I thought we'd install it together.

178
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,245
I texted you. What the fuck did you do?

179
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:03,205
You just ignored my text.
You could have at least replied.

180
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:06,365
And when my friend Sandeep
came from Delhi.

181
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:07,805
He came just once. For one day.

182
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,725
We had to go for dinner.
It was 50 minutes late.

183
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:12,485
-I was getting <i>vada pav</i> for your friend!
-It doesn't take 50 minutes.

184
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:15,125
-It didn't take 50 minutes.
-However long it took!

185
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:18,205
I text you every day like a fool, dude.

186
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,325
Fuck replying. You make me feel as if
you are ignoring me.

187
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:23,325
Half the time
I'm talking to myself it seems.

188
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,445
During your off-site,
you didn't even message me once.

189
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,685
I'm only begging you,
"What are you doing?"

190
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:28,925
Do you think I'm crazy?

191
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,965
Every day, I say the same thing,

192
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,765
"Let's go, mutton cutlet gravy."

193
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,365
I keep repeating it like a fool.
But you don't even listen to me.

194
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:39,605
Just surprise me once.
Come, let's go today.

195
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,525
And that moment,
one fucking moment,

196
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:46,245
when I was slightly in doubt,
when I was slightly vulnerable,

197
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,765
when I wasn't sure if I did
the right thing regarding my job,

198
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,805
I thought I'd talk to you
and what did you do?

199
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,045
Dude, you scolded me.

200
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:56,325
You were trying to make me feel bad
and you know it.

201
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:01,885
Fuck everything, dude.
Even for your own mother--

202
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:04,525
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
But what can I do?

203
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,525
This is on my mind.

204
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,405
Why didn't you say this
when it was happening?

205
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,165
Why did you have to keep it inside of you?

206
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:10,205
I didn't keep it inside.

207
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:12,405
Of course you did. Obviously you did!

208
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:15,285
I saw it and I was like,
it's okay, it happens.

209
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:18,285
It just went past.
But now I see the pattern.

210
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,925
Now I see. Now I'm joining the dots.
I'm like fuck, man!

211
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,885
You are changing!
You are in your own world.

212
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:25,765
I am changing? Why?
Because I am working hard every day?

213
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,365
Has it ever occurred to you
why I work so hard today?

214
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:30,445
That maybe it's because
I care about our future

215
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,125
-and our security unlike you.
-Unlike me?

216
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,885
-I don't care about us?
-No.

217
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:36,325
I don't?

218
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,445
No, Dhruv.

219
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:39,605
What the fuck do you mean by that?
Tell me.

220
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,925
Maybe you do, okay? But I think...

221
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,605
I think you're quite careless
and immature or whatever the hell--

222
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:50,645
How the hell am I immature, man?
What have I done?

223
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,765
I work, dude. I make money.

224
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,325
Not as much as you.
But that doesn't mean anything, right?

225
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:58,725
-Because I am also trying to work.
-That's not the point.

226
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:02,325
I know you are working, but you
don't think of the future the way I do.

227
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,445
-Money is important to me!
-I know that.

228
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,405
No! Money is important to me

229
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:08,485
for us to have a good, secure future!

230
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,325
-I know that!
-No, it really, really matters!

231
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,245
-I know that!
-No, you don't!

232
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,365
I know that.
I know it's important to you.

233
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,285
-No, it's different.
-How is it different?

234
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:17,885
-It is! You don't get it!
-How?

235
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,725
-It is, Dhruv!
-How is it different?

236
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:20,805
Do not touch me.

237
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:23,565
-How is it different? Tell me.
-It's different and you don't get it,

238
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,805
because if you did, then we
wouldn't having discussion.

239
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:26,725
Man!

240
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:30,925
We are having this fight right now
because you have this face that told me

241
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:33,365
that, "Dhruv, I have problem with you
having sex with me now."

242
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:35,605
What the fuck are you talking about?
Shut up!

243
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,485
Will you stop dramatizing everything?

244
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,245
You're making it sound worse
than what it was.

245
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:44,925
I just had that work thing on my mind

246
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:47,165
and I couldn't stop thinking
about it, okay?

247
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,285
I can't let go of things like you do.

248
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,805
I can't joke off things like you do.

249
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:54,405
-I can't act like--
-What do you mean by that?

250
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,725
No, what? Say it!

251
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:58,245
Say it!

252
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:01,085
-Your PhD?
-Fuck, same shit again!

253
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:02,325
-You quit your job.
-Again?

254
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:05,445
No, why? Let's talk about it.
You want to talk, I'm talking.

255
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:07,805
There's nothing to talk about,
it's not complicated.

256
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:11,045
I... was... getting... bored!

257
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,645
I wasn't enjoying myself.

258
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:14,885
-So I quit.
-You cannot quit things like that.

259
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:17,925
-You can't start quitting everything.
-You know what?

260
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,125
Yes, I can.

261
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:21,085
It's just that
I don't want to be slowed down.

262
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,405
And I don't want to be pulled back, okay?

263
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,205
Am I pulling you back?

264
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:30,005
Yes, Dhruv.

265
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,405
I'm sorry. Maybe slightly, but you are.

266
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,525
Fuck, man.

267
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:50,205
Dhruv, you don't care about our future.
You don't care about security.

268
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:53,245
You don't care about money.
Because you choose not to.

269
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,645
Cause you are just fine with everything.
Everything is okay.

270
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:57,645
-No, I am not.
-Of course, you are, Dhruv!

271
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,805
You are fine with having a bath
with a bucket and a mug--

272
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,805
What's the problem with a bucket
and a mug?

273
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:06,805
-What's the big deal?
-Exactly. See? You never get it.

274
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:09,245
There is nothing wrong with
having a bath with bucket and mug.

275
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:12,085
But if you can do better than that,
then you should.

276
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:14,645
I've been asking you
to fix that shower forever.

277
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,245
But you didn't
Cause you are fine.

278
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,725
You have a problem with it, not me.

279
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:19,605
If you have a problem ,
fix it yourself.

280
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:22,005
Why should I do everything?
You have to help me out here.

281
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:25,045
Help you out? Don't I work?
Do I watch TV all day at home?

282
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,805
Do it yourself. And you know what?

283
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:30,565
The first time I'm going to do
when I get back is get that shit fixed!

284
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,205
I've told you,
the issue is not at our end.

285
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,885
That bastard secretary
doesn't pick up my calls. What do I do?

286
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,205
But I'll get it fixed. You enjoy there.

287
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:41,085
You take 20 minute shower there.
As if you have the time to do that!

288
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:43,365
-As if you're enjoying the tub bath--
-Bathtub.

289
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:44,645
Fine, bathtub, tub bath!

290
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:52,445
Fuck, you don't like me, man.

291
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:54,845
No, that's the truth.

292
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,885
You don't like who I am actually.

293
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,325
You don't.

294
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,245
You have a serious problem with who I am.

295
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:03,885
And, honestly,

296
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:08,005
if it's that bad, you should find
someone like that fucking roadie.

297
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:09,765
In your own words,

298
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:12,165
he loved planning, right?

299
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,845
So just go ahead with it.

300
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:17,445
Kavya, maybe he is your type,
and I am not.

301
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:21,845
You're a liar.

302
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:34,925
No, I'm not.

303
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:38,165
I meant each and every word
that I said that night.

304
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:49,965
Listen.

305
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,205
Listen.

306
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,445
See, I care about this, man!

307
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:04,685
What we have right now!
This moment! Us! Us in this.

308
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,405
You think I don't care about this?

309
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:11,285
Do you know how difficult it is to plan it
and then manage to achieve that?

310
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,285
Do you think it's easy to try and be happy
and not chase something?

311
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,485
It's the same thing for me.

312
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:17,525
-It's not!
-For you!

313
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,805
Can't you see you're letting go
of what we have right now

314
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,605
because you are so worried about tomorrow?

315
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:27,685
Kavu, look at Keshav. He died, right?

316
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,485
We used to beat him at football.

317
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,085
Suddenly, one day he just died, man!

318
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,645
That's exactly why
we need to be prepared, Dhruv.

319
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:35,765
You can't not plan for the future

320
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:38,925
because you are so scared of growing up
and so scared of investing in it.

321
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,685
Let it go for now.

322
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,605
You keep planning and don't enjoy a thing.

323
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:51,845
-I know what the fuck I'm doing.
-No, you don't. I don't think you do.

324
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:54,205
Every time I say
let's go to a new restaurant,

325
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,285
every time I say
let's try something new to eat,

326
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:57,845
every time I say
have a new experience,

327
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,845
you put a stop to it.
Because you want to go to the same places,

328
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:03,605
you want to eat the same food,
you want to do the same things,

329
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,885
-again and again and again!
-You know why?

330
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,205
-Because that is us!
-No, Dhruv, this is us!

331
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,005
It can be us, in fact!

332
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,525
It's not, man. It's not.

333
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,725
You don't think so
because you don't give it a chance.

334
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:21,205
You said you'll stand by me!
You said you'll support me!

335
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,645
You said we're a team
and these are your words.

336
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:25,205
I'm not making this up.

337
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,845
It's just that you are changing so much.

338
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:31,085
It's not change, it's growth!

339
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:34,045
Yes, but it's coming at a cost.

340
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,205
What cost?

341
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:39,965
I can't...

342
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,205
-Laundry, sir?
-Yes.

343
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,165
Just wait a second.

344
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,165
Don't give your tie.

345
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:17,405
I've got you a new one, it's in my bag.

346
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:39,365
Where did you get this Liverpool tie from?

347
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:42,965
Satellite Mall.

348
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:44,885
I went there last night.

349
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:51,045
-Here.
-Thank you, sir.

350
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,965
