1
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:10,965
What is going on, Dhruv?

2
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:14,445
I can tell from your body language
that you are simply not interested.

3
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,245
I love your enthusiasm, Kavya.
It's almost contagious.

4
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,885
Look, Dhruv, you're smart,
you're intelligent,

5
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,125
but you have no motivation left.

6
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,925
Do you really want to work here?

7
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:31,845
Honestly, the way your work
has improved is truly commendable.

8
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:36,045
Look, your mind is clearly somewhere else.

9
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,325
Don't you think it's time to just move on?

10
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:45,965
Are you ready to start managing a team?

11
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:48,165
I know you will do really well.

12
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:53,245
So now what, like...
I don't have to come from tomorrow?

13
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:56,925
So, when do I take on the new role?

14
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:07,285
-Hello.
<i>-I want to tell you something!</i>

15
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:10,405
Yes, even I want to tell you something.

16
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:12,165
<i>I got a promotion and a raise!</i>

17
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:14,165
-What?
<i>-A fucking promotion and a--</i>

18
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,125
Okay. Congrats, congrats.

19
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,725
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>Yohan is throwing a party at his house.</i>

20
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,125
<i>It's a house warming. Be there by 7. Okay?</i>

21
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,245
<i>What did you want to tell?</i>

22
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:32,605
I found a guy selling dumplings.
Calls himself Taste of Darjeeling.

23
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,485
It's very good.
We should come here, you know.

24
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,565
-It's very good.
<i>-Dhruv, you are so cute, dude.</i>

25
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:41,845
<i>You eat them. Have some on me.</i>

26
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:43,605
<i>-Today is a very happy day.</i>
-Yeah.

27
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,725
<i>-See you. Love you.</i>
-Yeah. Happy day.

28
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:53,205
Give me some more, buddy.

29
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,005
Hi.

30
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,485
Please, take some more.

31
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:00,685
-Hi, Pizza Mania.
-Actually, I'm Dhruv.

32
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,725
-Dhruv?
-Kavya's boyfriend.

33
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:03,845
Pizza Mania.

34
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:06,685
-Dhruv, how are you?
-Yohan.

35
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:08,085
-I'm good. How are you?
-Very good.

36
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:09,485
-I'll get it.
-No, I'll do it.

37
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,685
-No, it's fine.
-Are you sure?

38
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,885
-Yes.
-Okay, thank you.

39
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:14,565
-You don't mind?
-No.

40
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:16,605
Please, come in. Thank you so much.

41
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,085
It's a beautiful house.

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,525
-Thank you.
-Give me some.

43
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,365
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah.

44
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,405
Is it uncomfortable?

45
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:25,965
Yeah.

46
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:29,885
-Hi!
-Congratulations.

47
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:32,085
Thank you. Dhruv!

48
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:33,485
-Are you drunk?
-No.

49
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:36,285
I'm very happy.
Twenty two lakhs per annum.

50
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,925
What are you serious? Twenty two?

51
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:40,845
-What the fuck?
-I know.

52
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:45,725
-Now you can buy everything.
-I'll buy a factory.

53
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,965
-Shut up!
-Listen, dude.

54
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:52,365
We should go to Moonlight to celebrate.

55
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:55,165
It's okay to celebrate with
other people sometimes.

56
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:56,885
Come, I'll show you the house.

57
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:59,525
-Hello.
-Wow, how are you doing?

58
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:00,965
-Good, dude.
-Good, man.

59
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:03,325
-You got pizza?
-Yes, let's go have some.

60
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,485
Let's go.

61
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,885
-Super unsure about it.
-About what?

62
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:10,165
It's too much.
I'm really bored with everything.

63
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:13,765
I'm bored with Tinder, my job sucks,
I'm bored with Zomato,

64
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,485
and even looking at pizza
makes me feel fat.

65
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:19,725
The final season of "Girls" is over and...

66
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,765
Look, if you are not happy,
you should quit.

67
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,285
Find something else.

68
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:27,125
It's better than being unhappy every day.

69
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,565
Yeah, she's right.

70
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:34,685
So, are you looking forward
to being in Bombay?

71
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:36,885
Yes, we very well should.

72
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,165
As in?

73
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,445
We've actually bought this house.

74
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:45,525
You bought a house in Bombay,
and a house like this!

75
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,525
-Really?
-It's nice, no?

76
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:51,045
-It's great!
-Thanks. And what do you do?

77
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,085
-I teach math online.
-Something like that exists?

78
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,445
Yeah, very much.

79
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,645
He's also a data analyst at a startup.

80
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,445
And what happened to the PhD?

81
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:04,205
-He's actually doing his PhD in math.
-Yeah, so I was, but I quit.

82
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,445
Yeah. But eventually
he might just get back to it.

83
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:10,885
I don't know about that, but... let's see.

84
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,405
I wasn't having fun.
It's really as simple as that.

85
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:15,565
Talk about not having fun.

86
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,925
I actually have to be a housewife
for 49 days.

87
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,405
Some kind of traditional ritual thing,
I tell you.

88
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,565
Is it really that bad?
You're staying at home,

89
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,045
you're doing work
and you're managing the house.

90
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,845
It's nice, right?
I wouldn't mind doing it.

91
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,845
Yes, but that's the difference, right?

92
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:33,165
When you choose to do it
versus when you are forced to do it.

93
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,565
Yes, fair point.

94
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,365
I kind of agree with Dhruv.

95
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:39,845
Who wouldn't want to sit at home
and take care of the house? Or just chill?

96
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,765
-Really?
-No?

97
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:44,165
Then you stay at home for 49 days.

98
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,885
-Chill.
-You can work if you want to.

99
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,165
I've just told her
not to post any pictures

100
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,165
on any of those social media sites.
That's it.

101
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:55,125
That's going to be difficult.

102
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:59,605
Anyway, we'll just got meet
a few other people.

103
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,885
-Yes, you please carry on.
-Have another drink.

104
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:03,245
-Help yourselves.
-See you.

105
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:04,725
See you.

106
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:11,365
Shut up.

107
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:15,085
Is this dessert?

108
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:16,685
Smells like it.

109
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:20,685
Be careful. It's not your dad's.

110
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:21,805
What?

111
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,765
Smell. It's dessert, right?

112
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:28,245
Sweet. It's not dessert. It's nice.

113
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:29,565
It smells like dessert.

114
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:32,005
Can you imagine he bought this house?

115
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,965
I know. People have so much money.

116
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:38,365
He must have planned it well.
It's not easily done.

117
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,205
Dude, how much could he have planned?

118
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:42,725
He's a CEO, right?

119
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:45,245
He's not a CEO, he's a bastard.

120
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,445
-Dhruv.
-What? He is a bastard, right?

121
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:51,845
The jerk has cheated on her.
Can you imagine?

122
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,245
It's their personal shit.
They'll figure it out on their own.

123
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:55,485
Yeah, but still!

124
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:58,085
The same office. Doesn't that feel weird?

125
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,205
This is my money also, no?

126
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:03,725
I mean, we're working as a team.

127
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,445
I'm just telling you to ask me
before you spend our money. That's it.

128
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,525
I won't say no, dude.

129
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:12,765
Yes, it is our money.

130
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,805
And I've kept all the records of it.

131
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,325
What's yours is yours.

132
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:20,365
If you want,
I can send you the document right away.

133
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,445
Do you want me to mail it to you, huh?

134
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,005
It feels awesome.

135
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:29,965
-Let me be their servant.
-Wow.

136
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,885
How ambitious!!

137
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,005
At least say "caretaker" or "manager."

138
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:37,485
Caretakers are also servants.

139
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,805
You]re in this bathroom,
that's why you're speaking English.

140
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:40,845
Same shit.

141
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:44,165
Did you talk to the sister about the gift?

142
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:50,285
No.

143
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,965
How do I say it to her?
It should come from her, no?

144
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:57,365
I mean, she knows that
the down payment is due.

145
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:58,965
Maybe she's forgotten.

146
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,525
Why don't you just remind her?

147
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:05,165
God, this is so tiring, dude.

148
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,125
We forgot to give them
a house warming gift.

149
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,885
No. Wait. I have it.

150
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:16,285
I have a two-day old cardamom.
Where has it gone?

151
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,365
-Dhruv.
-Where is it?

152
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:21,845
-It's okay. I have a better plan.
-Tissue.

153
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,325
I have <i>Lonely Planet Mumbai</i> in my bag,

154
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,605
we gift her that and we can write

155
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:31,045
all the stuff we love to do in the city
and places we love to go to.

156
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:32,565
That's actually nice.

157
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,245
-Isn't it? It'll be like our guide.
-Yeah. That's sweet.

158
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:41,245
It's not your dad's.

159
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,365
Take care of everything, Cherry.

160
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,485
And from now on,

161
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:51,525
absolute transparency.
Complete transparency, I promise.

162
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,165
Yes?

163
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,085
Yes, it's my car.

164
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,485
What is the matter?

165
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:12,365
Yes, it's our flat.
It's not a rental. Yes.

166
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,445
Extra for parking?

167
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:24,165
I won't give you any money at all, sir.

168
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,925
Because you guys think
we're fucking morons!

169
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:31,965
What?

170
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,005
Eight hundred thousand rupees, dude.

171
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,845
For parking. Bloody hell!

172
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,405
Listen.

173
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,045
I love you, okay?

174
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,325
I love you, too.

175
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:57,765
Shall we go?

176
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:00,605
Otherwise the appetizers
will be all gone.

177
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,565
Let's go.

178
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:09,165
They must have had sex.

179
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,445
What can you say?

180
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,285
So, do you think
Salman Khan is a virgin?

181
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:19,445
What the fuck?
You really think that he's a virgin?

182
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:21,925
-It's okay. I'm just asking.
-No, he's not.

183
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:23,805
Why does everybody think
Salman Khan is a virgin?

184
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,605
-I like him.
-So that doesn't make him a virgin.

185
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,205
God!

186
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,605
Salman Khan a virgin?
What the hell?

187
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,285
How much rent
do you and Kavya pay together?

188
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,605
Why, you planning to shift?

189
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:37,165
-I'm bored of my place.
-That doesn't mean you're going to shift.

190
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,245
-Istanbul is Turkey's capital, right?
-Yeah.

191
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,685
-Ankara.
-It's Istanbul.

192
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,085
-Ankara.
-No, Istanbul.

193
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,725
-Ankara.
-Yes, I just won 220 bucks.

194
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,805
-See?
-What? Was it Istanbul or Ankara?

195
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:50,125
-Ankara. Thank you.
-Since when did it become Ankara?

196
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:55,485
-These guys had sex, too.
-You guys good?

197
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,125
You know, for girls like us,

198
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:09,885
who belong to middle class
or upper middle class backgrounds,

199
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:12,285
it feels so nice, right?

200
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,885
You don't have to rely on a boyfriend,

201
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,805
or family for your needs.
You don't have to.

202
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:20,685
It's not like
we're chasing money or anything.

203
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:24,245
We just want to be self sustainable.
I want to be self sustainable.

204
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,085
I mean, tomorrow if I go to a store

205
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:28,725
and I spot a pair of shoes
that I really want to buy,

206
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:31,125
-then I should be able to buy it.
-Right.

207
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:34,605
It makes you feel so nice,
it makes you feel so empowered,

208
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:36,885
because you are saving.

209
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,525
Most of our mothers did not have
these experiences.

210
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:40,805
-Right?
-Right.

211
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:43,765
And on top of that, if you enjoy your job,

212
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,965
then it's the best. It's the best feeling.

213
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:49,325
-And our parents feel so relieved.
-Not just relieved. They are happy

214
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,045
they are proud of us.

215
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,885
-Show me.
-Show me yours.

216
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:59,605
What? Man, what a camera.

217
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,045
How much was it? It's great.

218
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,805
-It's free for you, brother-in-law.
-I'm not kidding. Tell me.

219
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,525
Not yet. We wanna take pictures first.

220
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,725
Where is Kavya? Have you seen her?

221
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,805
What are you doing? Shopping?

222
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,165
-What's the matter?
-Look at this. This website.

223
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,885
It calculates the time
you spend with the family

224
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:33,165
-when you are living away from them.
-Okay.

225
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:37,125
Let's say you live in a city,
and your parents live in another,

226
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:42,045
you meet them three, four,
let's say five times a year.

227
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,845
They average that out.

228
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:50,245
According to them, I will see my parents
for like now 321 days.

229
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:52,165
321 times.

230
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,885
For the rest of my life before they die.

231
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:58,885
-That's like one year.
-That's like one year.

232
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:02,645
Understand this, till now
I've seen them every day of my life.

233
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,765
Like, till I was 20 years old.

234
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:09,565
Now, in my remaining 30,
40, or 50 years,

235
00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:13,085
I will be with them just for one year.

236
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:20,085
We're fucking morons.

237
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:23,365
I'm selling light bulbs.

238
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:26,885
Why am I doing this?
Why am I so far away from them?

239
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,085
Check it out.

240
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:32,285
No, thanks. It's too depressing.

241
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,605
Such a nice finish, huh?
What an awesome house.

242
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,045
-Open the fridge.
-Open it.

243
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,885
Dude, I want to buy
a fridge for my parents.

244
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,245
Which one do I buy?

245
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:12,405
You're buying a fridge for your parents?
That's quite amazing.

246
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,165
As a kid, ten seemed a lot,
now 10,000 doesn't seem enough.

247
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,885
Right. I feel like that time was better.

248
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:21,045
Little is best.

249
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,525
What a privileged statement.

250
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,765
No, dude, "little" is not the right word.

251
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:30,885
-Simple is the right word, right?
-Yeah, right.

252
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:32,645
Simple is best.

253
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:33,885
Like trousers.

254
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,765
Wow, expensive cheese, huh?

255
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:40,445
-Where did you get it from?
-From the fridge.

256
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,765
-What?
-Seriously?

257
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:44,005
-From the fridge--
-You guys are shameless.

258
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,965
Kavya, he will demote you.

259
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:47,685
It's delicious. Try it.

260
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:49,765
Yes, I'll eat some, too.

261
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:52,045
What are you guys doing here?

262
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:53,645
And where are your drinks?

263
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,005
-Out there.
-Yes, outside.

264
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,045
-Lovely kitchen.
-Great kitchen.

265
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,525
Thank you.
It's great fun cooking over here.

266
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,645
-We should do a pot luck some day.
-Yeah.

267
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,525
-It's a great idea.
-It's a beautiful house, too.

268
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:06,725
Thank you. Me and Cherry just love it.
It's superb.

269
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,645
-Oh, boy. Not again.
-God.

270
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,445
Just give me a second, I'll figure it out.

271
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:15,845
Guys, just be careful. Please.
Just be careful.

272
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,765
Really sorry about this.

273
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:22,405
We'll just figure it out. Just be careful.

274
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,645
Guys.

275
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:10,405
Cherry?

276
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,325
What are you doing here?
Everyone is waiting outside.

277
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,765
-What are you looking at?
-Can't you see?

278
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:19,725
What?

279
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,565
What the fuck have we gotten into?

280
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,485
What are you thinking?

281
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:01,685
I quit my job.

282
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:07,125
I don't know. I don't know
whether they fired me or not, but...

283
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:09,885
What?

284
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,165
Really?

285
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:16,045
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

286
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:19,125
I was just scared to tell you
because you were having such a great day.

287
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,485
I was scared
that I'd ruin it or something.

288
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:23,245
We're a team, Dhruv.

289
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:29,605
Why will I be upset? I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

290
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:31,925
Want water?

291
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,045
-Sure? We can stop.
-Come here, baby.

292
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:38,805
Thank you.

293
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,125
What are you thinking?

294
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:00,845
Listen.

295
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:08,565
I quit my job. Or they fired me,
I still don't know.

296
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,485
What? When?

297
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,685
This morning.

298
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:20,005
And you didn't think it was important to
talk to me about it or discuss it with me?

299
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:22,045
Wait. Dude, it just happened.

300
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,645
Okay.

301
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:31,725
-Okay?
-Yes, okay.

302
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,205
What do you mean by, "Yes, okay"?
Say something more.

303
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:39,565
I'm just trying to process
this information right now, Dhruv.

304
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,205
Give me time.

305
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:44,685
What happened? Will you share the details?

306
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:48,885
Nothing. They figured 
I am not happy there.

307
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:52,725
I'm not enjoying work. So they gave me
an option and I chose to quit. Simple.

308
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:54,965
So they didn't fire you,
you chose to quit?

309
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:57,405
Yes. That's what happened.

310
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,685
I feel better now, suddenly, about it.

311
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,965
Screw feeling better, Dhruv!

312
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:04,925
You took such a big step
without even involving me in it!

313
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,845
Wait. You knew that I wasn't happy there.

314
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,885
Then you told about your promotion,
I thought you'll take care of the house,

315
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,125
I can chill for a bit.

316
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:14,925
Chill?

317
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:18,005
I know it's your decision, Dhruv,
and I know it's your life,

318
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:21,645
but you should have at least spoken to me.
We would have talked this through.

319
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:23,765
-It affects the both of us, Dhruv.
-Wait.

320
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,485
-Yes, but--
-You should not have quit like that.

321
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:30,365
Wait! Why not?

322
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,165
It's my decision, no?

323
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:35,805
Why aren't you asking me,
"Dhruv, are you happy or not?"

324
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:37,525
It was my decision, dude.

325
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,485
Dhruv, this is
a very irresponsible decision.

326
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:43,525
Dude, don't do that
irresponsible shit again, man!

327
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:44,645
Enough with it.

328
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,005
Repeating the same thing.

329
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,965
I didn't like it, I quit.

330
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:52,205
-The topic is over, finished.
-You are irresponsible, Dhruv.

331
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:53,725
Can't you admit it for once?

332
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:56,245
-You can't even fix the shower.
-Why do you keep saying that

333
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,325
I asked, the problem is not at our end.

334
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,925
It's the building's problem.
What should I do?

335
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,565
-Climb the pipe and fix it?
-You think they'll fix it?

336
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:05,805
Get it done. Do I have to take care
of it myself?

337
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:12,045
Kavya, why are you talking like this?
Listen to yourself.

338
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:17,685
You're sounding so rude. If this is how
you want to talk, then don't talk.

339
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,965
It's funny you're talking like this.

340
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:24,325
Remember how considerate I was
when you wanted to quit?

341
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:28,005
Dhruv, that was long time ago, okay?
Things have changed now.

342
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:30,845
How have they changed?

343
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:33,485
Aren't you realizing we're growing up now?

344
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,165
So we continue to grow up
irrespective of--

345
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,285
No! I want to grow up
in a particular direction.

346
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:42,485
Exactly. Which is why I quit.

347
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:45,925
Dhruv, when I wanted to quit,
I spoke to you about it.

348
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,925
That's where I'm coming from, okay?

349
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,205
You should have discussed this with me.

350
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:59,205
What would be the use of that? My decision
would still have been the same.

351
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:03,165
Wow. Thanks, dude,
for making me feel important.

352
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:06,045
In that case,
you shouldn't even have told me.

353
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,685
Why tell me? What difference does it make?

354
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:11,365
And how are you going to pay
your parents' loan?

355
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:13,005
You don't want to take money from me.

356
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,765
I don't even know
what you want to do anymore, Dhruv.

357
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,165
Your money is your money.
My money is my money.

358
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:22,325
You can pay it back when you have some.

359
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:25,045
You want me to take another loan?
I will die!

360
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,605
-You're realizing that now?
-Why are you talking like this?

361
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,525
Then don't give it back, it's okay.

362
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:33,325
What are you doing?
You are really mind fucking me now.

363
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:35,605
Dhruv, I'm just trying to help you, okay?

364
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:39,205
You should have at least...
I mean, I'm your girlfriend, Dhruv!

365
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:42,885
I don't even know
what you want to do anymore.

366
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:45,045
You're just quitting everything. I mean...

367
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:47,765
Are you even understanding
that it affects the two of us?

368
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:49,845
It's the two of us now.

369
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,445
Why are you pressuring me?

370
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,485
Kavya, why aren't you asking me,
"Dhruv, are you okay?

371
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:57,925
"Are you feeling okay?"

372
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,645
Why aren't you saying,
"We'll figure it out,

373
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:03,485
we're a team,
let's work it out together."

374
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,205
Why aren't you saying things like that?

375
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:06,845
What did you tell Akshara at the party?

376
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,005
If your heart is not in it,
then don't do it!

377
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:11,565
That's what I did.
Isn't it the same thing?

378
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:14,285
-It's not the same, Dhruv.
-How is it not the same?

379
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:17,125
Because my life does not depend
on Akshara, it depends on you.

380
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:20,405
Bro, it doesn't depend on me.
You make enough money.

381
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:23,165
So it's not about that. Stop cribbing.

382
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:25,925
That's not the dependency
I'm talking about, you know that.

383
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:28,485
I'm not cribbing,
I'm just concerned about you.

384
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,245
How are you concerned?
You're making me feel so shitty.

385
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:35,925
What? You don't even value my opinion,

386
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:38,645
you don't involve me
in big decisions that you take.

387
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,725
Dude, you knew about this!

388
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:46,525
Anyway, it's...

389
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,845
I'll work this out. I'll manage myself,

390
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:53,325
-I'll manage the house. Don't worry.
-That's not what I meant.

391
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:55,445
I'm sorry I looked out for your future.

392
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:58,885
You worry about yours,
I'll worry about mine, and we'll be fine.

393
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,045
I just said that
because I was happy, okay?

394
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,805
And then you said this
and it ruined whatever--

395
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:07,925
See? This is what it's about.
That I fucking ruined your day, no?

396
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:10,845
Did I ruin your day? Yes, I did!

397
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:12,125
That's not what I meant.

398
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:14,245
-Dude, you just said that!
-That's not what I meant!

399
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,285
But you said it, no? That's what
you said. That I ruined your day.

400
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:19,205
How? By telling you I fucking quit?

401
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:23,645
Enough already!

402
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:54,005
