1
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,960
-Hello. No, no, no.
-Please, please, please.

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,720
How is this fair? I got up early.
I switched on the geyser, I made coffee.

3
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,960
-I even woke you up. You remember?
-I know,

4
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,840
but I have a weekly meeting at 9:00.
Manoj Sir will kill me if I'm late,

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
and you can go at 1:00.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,880
I have to leave on time as well.
What's this?

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,000
You need to be more disciplined, Kavya.

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,240
Okay, Daddy. Next time.

9
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,600
I really wish I was.
If you were my daughter--

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,440
-If I were your daughter?
-Yes, if you were--

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,360
-Really?
-Yeah.

12
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,360
Isn't it weird for you to say that
considering the things we did at 3 a.m.--

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,360
Yeah, okay. Fine.
I know where you're going.

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,280
It sounded fine in my head.
But when I said it--

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,960
Why am I explaining myself?
Like, seriously, I'm getting late.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
Fun fact! Fun fact, fun fact.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,880
"Daddy" is the most searched keyword
on Pornhub.

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,640
You know what it is in India?
Quick, quick.

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,280
Guess, guess, guess.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,160
I don't know. Boob?

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,800
-Dhruv!
<i>-"Bhabhi"!</i>

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,360
-What?
<i>-"Bhabhi"</i> is the most searched keyword.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,560
Thanks for telling me that.
Now come out fast. I need to go.

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,360
And will you eat scrambled eggs?

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,760
Can you make French toast, please?

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,240
No, they take a lot of time,

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,560
-and I need to iron my clothes.
-I'll iron your clothes.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Please make it,
it'll take two extra minutes.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,720
-It's Monday morning. I need some boost.
-Yeah, fine.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,640
Glutton.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,720
Stop singing that song!

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,840
It's stuck in my head also, dude!
I need to get it out.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,400
These are really, really nice, dude.

34
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
What is this, Dhruv?

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,360
-What happened?
-This. Can't you see? Are you blind?

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,560
How did this happen, man?

37
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,560
You should have checked the iron
before using it.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,400
Now I have to wear this crumpled shirt
and go.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,480
And how many times have I told you
not to leave these here?

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,960
Wear something else, Kavya.

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,480
I don't have anything else to wear.
Nothing else is ironed.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,280
And I am running super late, anyway.
So selfish, Dhruv.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,360
Just finish your stupid toasts.
Have a nice day!

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,640
<i>The doors are about to close.</i>
<i>Please come in.</i>

45
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,960
Seventh floor.

46
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,120
I think that's a good idea.

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,800
Kavya, you're late again.

48
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Have a seat.

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,600
Like I was saying, let's have the clients
to sign off the order size first.

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,120
Otherwise, we'll start processing,
and they'll have some last-minute changes.

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,400
You know how the clients are.
Sana, you can make a note of it.

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
How many times
should I send identification?

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,280
I've already sent it thrice.

54
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,560
No, dude.
The permanent address is in Delhi!

55
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,800
I've already told you this.

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
Look, sort it out quickly. It shouldn't
take so much time to renew a passport.

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,320
Thank you.

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,920
What's up?

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,560
What's wrong? Why are you making
that face? Did Uber have surge pricing on?

60
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Don't start with me, man.

61
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,680
Fine.

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,160
Anyway, my RAM isn't working. Okay?

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,080
I'm very busy.

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
It's just been a shitty morning.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,640
First, I had a fight with Kavya
over something stupid,

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,200
and then this passport renewal mess.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
That's the thing about girls, right?

68
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Saloni is also very weird in the morning.

69
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,720
Will you stop comparing
your one-night stands

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,640
to my two-year-long relationship?

71
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,640
I have something for you.

72
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,200
Where is it? Yeah.

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Here. Isn't this yours?

74
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,240
Funny, dude. Very mature.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,560
Very mature.

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Listen.

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,000
Hey, Aakash, listen, man.

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,920
What is it?

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,120
-Did you get any e-mail from Stockholm?
-Not yet. And you?

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
No, man.

81
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Kavya! Did you find out

82
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,160
why the Eternity Mall guys
haven't replied to us on the pricing?

83
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm just following up on that, sir!

84
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,640
Why can't I find the stupid e-mail, man?
I swear I sent it.

85
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,760
When did you send it?

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,600
Sometime last week. I cc'd you on it, no?

87
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,880
Kavya.

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,240
Why are you wearing just one earring?
Did you drop the other one somewhere?

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,640
Shit, shit, shit. I can't lose these.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,200
These are the ones Dhruv gifted me
on my birthday.

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,480
These are the VelvetCase ones?

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
-Yeah.
-Oh, shit.

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
-Hey, the Stockholm e-mail is here!
-What are you saying?

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,880
Yes!

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
<i>White chicks, white chicks</i>
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,680
<i>What you gonna do when I come for you?</i>

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,960
What's up?

98
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,240
-I didn't get through, dude.
-Yeah, right. Don't bullshit me.

99
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,680
"I regret to inform you that your paper,
'The Injectivity of Isometric Numbers'

100
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,160
has not been accepted for presentation
at 27th Nordic Congress--"

101
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,080
Enough, dude.

102
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,880
My paper's not getting accepted, dude.

103
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
Dude, I'm sure

104
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
we'll figure something out.

105
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,920
If my papers are not getting cleared,
how will I get a degree?

106
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,240
That doesn't matter. How could you
send them our internal costing?

107
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,440
You were supposed to send the quotes.
No wonder they haven't replied.

108
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,240
They'll come back with some shitty pricing
now that they know our costs.

109
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
I know, sir.

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,200
I must have forwarded them
the wrong attachment.

111
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,200
This is some seriously shoddy work,
Kavya. Seriously.

112
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,160
This is the second time this month
that such a thing has happened.

113
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,080
It's such a huge order for the company.
Why couldn't you be more careful?

114
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,920
What's happened to you?

115
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm sorry, sir.

116
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,440
I mean, Dhruv,
there are many options, man.

117
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,560
Illinois, Ohio, Toronto.
There are so many other options.

118
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,800
Those are all the difficult ones, man.
This was an easy backup.

119
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,920
Let me get you something.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
-Aakash, don't joke now.
-Wait.

121
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,040
Please don't do it, man.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,840
What the fuck?

123
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,400
Exactly. Look at this beauty.

124
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,640
This is Rao Sir's

125
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
special stash.

126
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I refill it from time to time
with Coke and water.

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,640
Come, let's have a few drinks.
We'll fix your mood.

128
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,880
Let's have biryani.

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,920
Will you have some?

130
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
Yeah.

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,960
-Keema or Afghani? Tell me.
-Anything. You're paying, either way.

132
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,320
Fine, it's my treat.

133
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,880
Let me just check.

134
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,080
Little App has 30 percent off on Keema.

135
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
-Keema it is.
-Wait, wait.

136
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
We aren't going out to eat, are we?

137
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,680
-I need to work on these applications.
-No. It's not a dine-in offer.

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
It's a delivery.

139
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,840
Listen... make it three, man.

140
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,040
-Three biryanis?
-Yeah, make it three.

141
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
Sure?

142
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,160
Yeah.

143
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,320
Okay.

144
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
Madam,

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,160
there's a parcel from Dhruv.

146
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,960
<i>I know I don't deserve</i>
<i>a gold medal in ironing.</i>

147
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,240
<i>But I have a decent track record</i>
<i>in gluttony.</i>

148
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,640
<i>Sending you some of me, packed in a box.</i>

149
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,000
Ate too much, right?

150
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,600
Drank a lot too, man.

151
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
That's fine.

152
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
Whiskey, biryani, kebab.
Perfect afternoon.

153
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,400
I know.

154
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,360
Just needed some Jagjit Singh, right?

155
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
And babes.

156
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,920
<i>Once upon a time, there was a boy</i>
<i>called Dhruv who was very nervous</i>

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,520
{\an8}<i>because he was racing</i>
<i>the fastest boy in town.</i>

158
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,960
{\an8}<i>The winner of the race would win</i>
<i>100 Twix bars, 50 shawarmas,</i>

159
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,680
<i>40 French toasts and 50 momos.</i>

160
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,160
<i>Given that these were</i>
<i>all of his favorite things,</i>

161
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,840
<i>Dhruv was in no mood to lose.</i>

162
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,280
<i>But how do you defeat</i>
<i>the fastest boy in town?</i>

163
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,720
<i>The race started, and at the halfway mark,</i>
<i>Dhruv started to feel very tired.</i>

164
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,360
<i>He couldn't run any longer.</i>

165
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,560
<i>But then Dhruv suddenly heard</i>
<i>somebody cheering his name loudly</i>

166
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,760
<i>from the sidelines. "Dhruv! Dhruv! Dhruv!"</i>

167
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,880
<i>Amidst the huge crowd,</i>
<i>his eyes locked in on his best friend,</i>

168
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,400
<i>the Biryani Monster,</i>
<i>who with all her might</i>

169
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,800
<i>was cheering for him.</i>

170
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,040
<i>Something happened to Dhruv</i>
<i>and he started to believe in himself</i>

171
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,840
{\an8}<i>and he ran and ran</i>
<i>like he'd never run before.</i>

172
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,840
{\an8}<i>Before he knew it,</i>
<i>he had defeated the fastest boy in town</i>

173
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,840
<i>and was celebrating his victory</i>
<i>with his best friend, the Biryani Monster.</i>

174
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>As the two of them hugged, his best friend</i>
<i>whispered into his ear,</i>

175
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,640
<i>"You will never walk alone."</i>

176
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,760
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the fuck! You scared me!

177
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
Biryani Monster! Come here.

178
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,720
-Are you wearing my jewelry?
-I'm Bappi Da, bro.

179
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,120
Shit, is that my earring?

180
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
Yeah, you left it here this morning.

181
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,160
Shit, I thought I'd lost it.

182
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,040
Stop talking so much.

183
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,080
Dance, bro. And this is how you get a song
out of your head.

184
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Your shirt is looking really good.

185
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm sorry, dude.

186
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,520
But how did this happen?

187
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,880
-Don't laugh. You know I didn't--
-It's funny.

188
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,280
You have no idea
how boring it gets at work.

189
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,480
And anyway, I was distracted.

190
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,120
I told myself that I'll not be
on Facebook more than 15 minutes

191
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,080
-then I saw this really cool--
-Of course.

192
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,680
Shut up. I saw this really cool article
about 10 places to visit under 5000 bucks.

193
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,760
And I started reading the article
and planning a holiday.

194
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,160
And then I got distracted.

195
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,280
My concentration said,
"Bye-bye, Kavya. I'll see you later."

196
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,240
But you can't be on Facebook
when you're working.

197
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,520
-It's as simple as that. Wait.
-Thanks.

198
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,880
Even I'm always on Facebook.
You know what?

199
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,840
Download this app called SelfControl.

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,320
Aakash uses it all the time.

201
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,240
You just have to feed in your work hours,
and it just blocks Facebook.

202
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,000
Even if you delete the app
you still can't access it.

203
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,320
<i>Jugaad.</i>

204
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,680
That'll make my day
a million times more boring.

205
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,840
But then you won't screw up like this.

206
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,680
That's true. Thanks... Daddy.

207
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,920
You know,
that thing really turns me on, dude.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,440
-It really, really, really turns me on.
-Shut up.

209
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,800
-You know what I did after lunch today?
-What?

210
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,800
I gifted my boss <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>
as an anonymous person.

211
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,680
What? Are you mad or what?
Like, seriously?

212
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,000
As you know, madness is like gravity.
All you need is a little push.

213
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,360
-Batman.
-What Batman? Say Dark Knight.

214
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,320
Yeah, same thing.

215
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,680
By the way,
your boss can figure out it's you.

216
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,160
You know, he just has to register
one complaint

217
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,280
and he'll know.
Ms. Kavya Kulkarni, you are so screwed.

218
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,720
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

219
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,120
So, do something.

220
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,800
Put your PhD to some use.

221
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,760
Overrule the command.

222
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,040
-What?
-Cancel the order.

223
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,200
Oh, yeah! That was easy, man.

224
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,920
Shit.

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,920
For a moment I was shit scared.

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,760
But don't worry! Your maths program...

227
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,400
<i>Ganit, ganit, ganit.</i>

228
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah. In your <i>ganit</i> program
keep using <i>jugaad.</i>

229
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,920
-Cartoon, it's not <i>jugaad!</i>
-Of course it is <i>jugaad.</i>

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,720
Not <i>jugaad.</i> There's a word for it.
Wait, I'll tell you.

231
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
-What is it?
-What is it?

232
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
Say.

233
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,240
I don't know.

234
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,840
So, what's for dinner?

235
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,080
-I'm not that hungry.
-Don't say that.

236
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,640
I'll just reheat the French toast
and eat it.

237
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,120
Those are... gone.

238
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,040
Where?

239
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,440
Dhruv.

240
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,480
They were tasty. I was really hungry,
so I was like, "Fuck it,

241
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,520
I'll eat it."

242
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
-What do I eat now?
-Oh, do you want pasta?

243
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,560
-Are you making it?
-Yeah, I'll make it.

244
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,200
-You want?
-Okay, cool. Fine.

245
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,600
I'll come and chop the vegetables.

246
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,920
Actually, no. No. I'm not gonna do that.

247
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,960
Thought so.

248
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,000
You go. You do everything.
I'll just talk to you and distract you.

249
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
-Of course. Sorted.
-Sorted.
