1
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:11,725
Bro. Nice tie.

2
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:14,285
Thanks.

3
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:15,925
Where did you get it?

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,365
She got it, dude.
From Satellite Mall in Bombay.

5
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:25,285
She gifted your a Liverpool tie?

6
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:28,845
What a girlfriend, bro.

7
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:41,325
Hey, bro.

8
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:46,805
Are you eating?

9
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:50,845
-Why is everyone so dressed up?
-Let it go.

10
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,485
I want to see what bit you.

11
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:01,485
Sorry! Fuck!

12
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:03,645
Sorry!

13
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,805
Have a lemon!

14
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:11,085
Nice. Come on, Kavya!
Come on, make her drink. Yes.

15
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:12,925
-I will take it.
-Yes. Drink.

16
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:18,205
Nice. Now it's your turn, buddy.

17
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:20,245
-No, dude, let it be.
-What do you mean?

18
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:23,565
-I don't feel like it. Will drink beer.
-It's not Mr. Rao's booze. It's mine.

19
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,445
It's my wedding. Please, tell him.

20
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,485
Drink, you jerk.

21
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:29,925
Nice!

22
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,405
-What are you doing?
-Wait and see.

23
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,645
You're not happy at the wedding?

24
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,605
Bastards! Assholes!

25
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:22,605
Fuck! Fuck you guys!

26
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:30,485
-Fucking assholes, dogs! Fuck, fuck!
-What happened? Aakash?

27
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:31,405
What is it?

28
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:17,405
-Why aren't the waiters getting us food?
-Sorry?

29
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:20,485
Nothing.

30
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:26,845
I'll just come back.

31
00:03:57,765 --> 00:04:00,205
Look. There is green chutney as well.

32
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,725
It's his first day,
so I wished him luck from our side.

33
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,085
Okay.

34
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:13,645
Hold this, I'm getting a call.

35
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,125
Aakash is calling.

36
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,205
Yes, what's up?

37
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:27,165
What? Right now? Is everything all right?

38
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,725
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.
I'll be right back.

39
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:39,845
This is a romantic moment, right?

40
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,285
Sorry. Everyone is wasted.
I had to disturb you.

41
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:44,605
Are you crazy?
I'll tell this to your kids.

42
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:49,085
That I zipped their father's pants
on his wedding day.

43
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,285
-Shut up. The wedding is good, right?
-Yes, it's great.

44
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:56,525
I love the beds! They are so... jumpy!
Have you...

45
00:04:58,605 --> 00:04:59,805
-What?
-Had sex?

46
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:04,205
-Tell me.
-Sorry.

47
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,205
Don't you want to see the dances?

48
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:10,045
For the past two months I've been
doing nothing but watching dances.

49
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,685
I haven't seen Nandini's dance yet.

50
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:16,525
And she doesn't know
that I am performing for her.

51
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:19,685
-Are you serious? Solo dance?
-Yes!

52
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:21,005
That's great!

53
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:23,605
Fix your hair.

54
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:27,005
But will you be able to do it?
Look at your hand.

55
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,365
Bro, I'm the groom. I'll do everything.

56
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,925
Let that be. Leave it like that.

57
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:10,365
Will you tell me something?

58
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:12,725
From the back.

59
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:16,445
-Done?
-Why is it so tight?

60
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:19,205
-Because you think you're slim.
-Fuck you.

61
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,045
One second. I'll do it.

62
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:29,045
How did you figure that you wanted
to get married to Nandini? Like...

63
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:32,565
What's wrong with you?
What a Bollywood like question to ask.

64
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:34,405
-No, I mean it.
-You and Kavya?

65
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,405
No, I mean, no, not like "no", but...

66
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,245
-We're not thinking about it.
-You can tell me.

67
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:43,725
Of course I can. But I'm just asking.
How did you know Nandini was the one?

68
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,365
We couldn't find a house
after looking for three months.

69
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:49,525
-Are you fucking serious?
-No, of course not.

70
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,845
I mean, that was
one of the reasons. But...

71
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:55,885
I don't know. It wasn't that...
It wasn't anything major, dude.

72
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:59,685
I mean, the day I thought of it,
I was just... fine.

73
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:02,725
When I wanted to ask
that girl in the eight grade,

74
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,365
"Will you be my friend?"
I was freaking out more then.

75
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:10,845
With Nadidni it was... What will happen
after marriage, dude? You know?

76
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:15,045
And when I thought of like,
"Why Nandini?"

77
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:18,365
I was like, "I can talk to her."

78
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,805
Whenever, wherever,  whatever.

79
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:24,485
I mean, even if I am fighting with her,
I can talk to her. You know?

80
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,525
And that makes it...

81
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:28,845
very sacred.

82
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,605
It's Nandini, man. And it's me.
It's Aakask and Nandini.

83
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:37,525
It's fun. It's the best.

84
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:40,485
Finally.

85
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,645
What are you doing?
Why are you taking it off?

86
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,565
What the fuck are you doing?
You arm will get worse.

87
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:49,725
-It won't. Just...
-Are you sure?

88
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:53,325
-How else will I wear the coat?
-Okay, all right. Yeah.

89
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:54,325
Take it off.

90
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,445
<i>-Briyani?</i>
-Yep. <i>Briyani.</i>

91
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:25,805
How did you get it?

92
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:30,205
I just realized...
that if I can't keep my Kavu happy,

93
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:32,885
at least I can try to keep
my <i>biryani </i>monster happy.

94
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,205
But dinner is not even served yet.
How did you manage?

95
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:41,125
I'm the groom's friend,
everything is possible.

96
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:44,525
Is it nice?

97
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,245
Thank you.

98
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,605
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,125
Even I am sorry.

100
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,285
I mean it, okay?

101
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,685
Even I mean it.

102
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:06,045
-Are you crying?
-What? No!

103
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:10,565
I know you were, though.

104
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:16,365
I felt like crap. Really.

105
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,765
And you should.

106
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,165
The tie has worked wonders.

107
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,445
Full on, bro!

108
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:30,365
-But besides that, we need to talk.
-Yeah.

109
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:32,325
We need to.

110
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,605
We don't need to talk right now,
we can talk later.

111
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:39,845
Listen.

112
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:42,885
Can you take the day off tomorrow?

113
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,605
-I already did.
-What?

114
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:47,565
Really?

115
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:51,165
What else do you think
I was doing on the phone right now?

116
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:54,765
-You turned out to be pretty smart.
-You've got a gem of a girl.

117
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,805
Kavu? Party animal?

118
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:37,365
I'm dead.

119
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:41,845
You're alive.

120
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:45,965
-Why would you do that?
-Take this. For the hangover.

121
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:47,405
Thanks.

122
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:58,405
Where are we?

123
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:34,005
Forget that.

124
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,045
-Here, a souvenir.
-Thank you.

125
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,445
-How come we're at Sula, though?
-Just...

126
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:44,045
I was getting a feeling
that we are forgetting ourselves.

127
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,485
And you may know this already.

128
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,405
It's good to come back to familiar places,

129
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:51,645
because those places help you
remember who you really are.

130
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,645
And you are right.
I am a little disorganized.

131
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:00,005
And I don't know why
but I can't look at the bigger picture.

132
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:03,485
I'm selfish as well.

133
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:10,085
Look, I know
I have been preoccupied and

134
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,685
I have been juggling 100 things
at the same time.

135
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,885
So obviously I mess up
with a thing or two.

136
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:20,525
But somehow the thing
just ends up being about us.

137
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:25,485
And...

138
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:28,885
why do you think that's the case?

139
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,565
Because I take us for granted.

140
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,805
I know I do, I...

141
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:38,445
I know I shouldn't, but I do.

142
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,285
Last night was really uncomfortable.

143
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:48,605
I know, but...

144
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:54,565
comfort comes from
uncomfortable things.

145
00:13:57,005 --> 00:14:00,365
You know, yesterday, after the fight
when I saw you sitting there,

146
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:04,205
I didn't see this curly-haired girl
with kohl just sitting there,

147
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:06,245
I saw you.

148
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,245
And I saw you after a very,
very long time.

149
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,565
You know, I really love you, man.

150
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:15,925
Genuinely.

151
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,965
I don't know.
I had a weird pain in my stomach...

152
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,845
and I don't ever want
to feel that again.

153
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:36,725
You know, Dhruv?

154
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,205
It's really important for me
to work hard, be independent.

155
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:43,685
Be self-sufficient.

156
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:48,245
And it's not about me wanting something
or not wanting something,

157
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:51,445
or bathing with a bucket and a mug.

158
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:55,525
It's... it's much more than that.

159
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:58,205
-I know that.
-No. I don't think you do.

160
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:00,605
I know it seems obvious, but...

161
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,685
I don't think you really know
where I'm coming from.

162
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:08,005
My parents never stopped me
from doing anything.

163
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,565
They always taught me to excel in
everything I do.

164
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,885
They always taught me
to be self-sufficient.

165
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:18,565
Honestly, Kavu, it's never been
my intention to stop you.

166
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:20,165
No, I know, Dhruv. I...

167
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,045
I'm not saying that. I'm just...

168
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:25,445
I'm just telling you
where I am coming from.

169
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:29,445
I'm also figuring this out as we go along.

170
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,965
I just need your support
with whatever I decide.

171
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:36,605
What happened?

172
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:40,885
I am suddenly thinking how different
my childhood was.

173
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,565
So, very early in life my parents figured
out that this boy has brains.

174
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:52,445
So throughout my schooling life,
they pushed me to work harder and harder.

175
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,765
When I entered college, I realized,
fuck, I didn't really have a childhood.

176
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:00,765
Then I was like, "Now I have to have fun."

177
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:04,085
And trust me when I say this,
I'm not making excuses,

178
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:07,765
but I wasn't enjoying my PhD.

179
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,485
Of course, it was fun at the start,
that's why I did it.

180
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:15,205
But... It was...
I'm not unambitious it's just...

181
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:16,925
I wasn't liking it.

182
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:19,925
It just felt like school,
it felt like my job,

183
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:21,165
It just felt like...

184
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,805
"What? This is all there is?"

185
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:29,685
Yeah, but anyway,
now it's all about living a life

186
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:32,045
with a pace I can control myself.

187
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,485
That's not how it works.

188
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:41,125
It's not that easy when you're
living in the real world, Dhruv.

189
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,365
I know where you are coming from.
I hear you. And...

190
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:50,605
I need to start caring about this, too,
instead of just thinking about the future.

191
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,285
And I will.

192
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:01,365
Dhruv, there is one more thing, and I...

193
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,885
I just want you to agree with me,
irrespective of whatever happens.

194
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:09,245
I want to help you with your family loan.

195
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:14,805
-Yes, but the thing is--
-Dhruv.

196
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,525
Okay, fine.

197
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:22,805
Thank you.

198
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,485
No. Thank you.

199
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:34,245
Fuck, dude.
We've started talking about those things.

200
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:36,285
Life over career, career over life.

201
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:42,285
-Why does everything seem so cliché?
-Because it is cliché.

202
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,805
You were right when you say
we are not extraordinary people.

203
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:50,965
We have to, in fact, work extra hard
to make our every day special.

204
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,085
So, we'll do that, right?

205
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:59,565
Dhruv?

206
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,605
Do you realize we both look at the world
so differently?

207
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:12,645
It's not going to be easy, but...
we have to keep at it, right?

208
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:39,845
What's this?

209
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:42,445
Is it milk?

210
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:53,165
It smells weird.

211
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,085
I think the neighboring lady
made something.

212
00:18:58,765 --> 00:18:59,885
You've did this, right?

213
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,685
Mutton cutlet?

214
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:12,925
I mean, seriously?

215
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,765
Like, where is this from?

216
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,005
-From Moonlight, Momo.
-What?

217
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,005
But how? Like, they don't deliver, dude.

218
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:24,525
-I know.
-What do you mean I know? Tell me!

219
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,805
I called the owner, I requested him.

220
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:31,205
He cooked it at home,
and his boy delivered it.

221
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,525
Why don't I feel like crying?

222
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:43,005
How is it?

223
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:55,925
I think it's gone bad.

224
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,805
What happened? It's okay.

225
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:06,685
This could have been perfect, no?

226
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,725
Why are you sad? We can try
that new Chinese place, no?

227
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:25,285
Let's go.

228
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,445
It's not supposed to be perfect.

229
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,445
It's just supposed to be us, right?

230
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:02,525
Let's go or it will close. Then we'll
come back and I will have to make Maggi.

231
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:05,085
-What about scrambled eggs?
-I'll have to make that, too.

232
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,125
-Right.
-Let's go.

233
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:10,445
-I cook, too, you know.
-Yes, bread and butter.

234
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:13,365
Shut up! Have you never eaten
anything I cooked?

235
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:15,445
We had that chili...

236
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,085
What recipe is that?
