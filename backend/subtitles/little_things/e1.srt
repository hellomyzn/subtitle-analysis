<font color="white">Hi, my name is Dhruv Vats.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I hope you are enjoying my math lessons.</font>

2
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,085
<font color="white">Today, we will talk about calculus.</font>

3
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:17,885
<font color="white">Calculus is made up of two parts.</font>

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,125
<font color="white">Differentiation and integration.</font>

5
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:22,605
<font color="white">Teacher, give me some knowledge, too.</font>

6
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:25,765
<font color="white">Where did you come from, bro?</font>
  
  <font color="white">How are you doing, bro?</font>

7
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,725
<font color="white">-How are you?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Great.</font>

8
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,965
<font color="white">-I'll have to do this again, you jerk.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Do it. Who is stopping you?</font>

9
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:34,045
<font color="white">-What is this? What have you got here?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-It's mine.</font>

10
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:35,605
<font color="white">You've gotten so fat!</font>

11
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:37,325
<font color="white">-Yes, you jerk.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Sit, sit.</font>

12
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,965
<font color="white">When you meet after four years,</font>
  
  <font color="white">it becomes mandatory to say that.</font>

13
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,405
<font color="white">-That's true. It's good to see you.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Here you go. Something to eat?</font>

14
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,325
<font color="white">-What did you eat?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Dude, sorry.</font>

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,885
<font color="white">I had two chickens on the flight, dude.</font>

16
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:51,965
<font color="white">-Do you have beer?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Beer? At this time?</font>

17
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,325
<font color="white">Bro, it's 2:50 at night.</font>

18
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:58,125
<font color="white">So one can't kid around</font>
  
  <font color="white">at 2:50 at night?</font>

19
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:01,725
<font color="white">-Were you kidding? Tell the truth.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Let it go.</font>

20
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,445
<font color="white">-You two, tell me something.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Yes.</font>

21
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,525
<font color="white">-How can you live here?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Why?</font>

22
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,405
<font color="white">-The city stinks and its humid.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-We're used to it.</font>

23
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,165
<font color="white">Yeah, it's home now.</font>

24
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:14,765
<font color="white">Sister-in-law,</font>

25
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:17,645
<font color="white">I've got a gift for you</font>
  
  <font color="white">for Liverpool's 4th defeat.</font>

26
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,005
<font color="white">You're really enjoying this, huh?</font>

27
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:22,205
<font color="white">Guys, stop it.</font>
  
  <font color="white">Don't start with this now. Really.</font>

28
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:25,885
<font color="white">Also, please don't address me</font>
  
  <font color="white">as sister-in-law.</font>

29
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,645
<font color="white">-Why? Don't you guys plan on marrying?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Hari Om?</font>

30
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:33,445
<font color="white">You got it from Hari Om?</font>
  
  <font color="white">Oh, bro. Milk cake?</font>

31
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:35,605
<font color="white">You are a real bro.</font>

32
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:40,685
<font color="white">You fucking love it.</font>

33
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:47,525
<font color="white">His son opened Harry's Hookah Bar</font>
  
  <font color="white">and Hari Om Gym, bro.</font>

34
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:51,965
<font color="white">One place to make you fat</font>
  
  <font color="white">and another to help you lose weight.</font>

35
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,405
<font color="white">It's wonderful. I love it, bro.</font>

36
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,565
<font color="white">-Sister-in-law looks really sleepy.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Please, dude.</font>

37
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,605
<font color="white">I really have a very long day tomorrow</font>
  
  <font color="white">and a very important meeting.</font>

38
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,325
<font color="white">I'm going to sleep. You guys have fun.</font>

39
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:08,125
<font color="white">You go to sleep.</font>
  
  <font color="white">We'll have fun the entire night.</font>

40
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,205
<font color="white">-Right?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-To tell you the truth, dude,</font>

41
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,485
<font color="white">I'm also a bit sleepy. I'm tired, dude.</font>

42
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,285
<font color="white">How are you tired?</font>
  
  <font color="white">You were sitting here tutoring.</font>

43
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,245
<font color="white">It takes effort. It's work, too.</font>

44
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,845
<font color="white">-Good night.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Good nuts.</font>

45
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,085
<font color="white">-What?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Nothing.</font>

46
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,045
<font color="white">-Tell me.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-I'll tell you later. Chill.</font>

47
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,125
<font color="white">He will tell you later.</font>

48
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:27,605
<font color="white">Silly boys. Good night.</font>

49
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,845
<font color="white">So? What are you doing?</font>
  
  <font color="white">Shall we watch FTV?</font>

50
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,405
<font color="white">-If you're watching that, I'll join you.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Okay.</font>

51
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,525
<font color="white">Fucking hell. She's great.</font>
  
  <font color="white">Where did you find her?</font>

52
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:40,165
<font color="white">What do you mean where did I find her?</font>

53
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:43,365
<font color="white">Why does everyone ask me that?</font>
  
  <font color="white">"Where did you find her?"</font>

54
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,525
<font color="white">I won the lotto, you jerk.</font>

55
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:48,605
<font color="white">Karan said exactly the same thing.</font>
  
  <font color="white">"Where did you find her?"</font>

56
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:52,125
<font color="white">What is it? Am I nothing?</font>
  
  <font color="white">It's too much, dude.</font>

57
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,565
<font color="white">He was the one who told me to ask you.</font>

58
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:59,365
<font color="white">You guys are bastards.</font>
  
  <font color="white">All of you are real bastards.</font>

59
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,365
<font color="white">Dude, we'll meet tomorrow. I'm tired.</font>

60
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,925
<font color="white">-Okay, then, good nuts.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Good nuts.</font>

61
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:07,565
<font color="white">Sleep well.</font>

62
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,645
<font color="white">Listen, the toilet is here.</font>

63
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,685
<font color="white">Lift the seat, okay?</font>

64
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,965
<font color="white">What do you mean by "lift the seat"?</font>

65
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:22,445
<font color="white">Am I am a caveman and I don't know</font>
  
  <font color="white">I should lift the seat?</font>

66
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,005
<font color="white">Or we don't have toilets in our homes?</font>
  
  <font color="white">Or the toilets don't have seats?</font>

67
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:27,885
<font color="white">Don't we know?</font>
  
  <font color="white">Or that I only go Indian style?</font>

68
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,405
<font color="white">I was just saying, dude.</font>

69
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:33,045
<font color="white">Take it as a joke. What's the big deal?</font>
  
  <font color="white">Shall I get some cold water?</font>

70
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:34,925
<font color="white">I know it's in the fridge, I'll take it.</font>

71
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,405
<font color="white">Also, sister-in-law has left some.</font>
  
  <font color="white">Thank you.</font>

72
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,605
<font color="white">-Let me know if you need anything.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Go away!</font>

73
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:43,245
<font color="white">Once you go, I'll check Tinder.</font>

74
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:46,445
<font color="white">You jerk, that's why you've come</font>
  
  <font color="white">to Bombay, right? To check Tinder.</font>

75
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,325
<font color="white">Seriously, tell me. Do you need anything?</font>

76
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,405
<font color="white">-Two things.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Yes, tell me.</font>

77
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,285
<font color="white">First, give me your loosest pair</font>
  
  <font color="white">of shorts because I forgot mine.</font>

78
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:57,645
<font color="white">Sure. And?</font>

79
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:00,445
<font color="white">And, secondly,</font>
  
  <font color="white">where does one masturbate here?</font>

80
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:07,165
<font color="white">-What are you saying?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-I'm serious, bro.</font>

81
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:09,245
<font color="white">-Naturally.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Naturally. It's a bodily need.</font>

82
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:12,405
<font color="white">-Otherwise I'll mess up your home.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Yeah, right.</font>

83
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,765
<font color="white">Look at your face!</font>

84
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:17,245
<font color="white">-Good night.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Good nuts.</font>

85
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,325
<font color="white">Okay.</font>

86
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:05,005
<font color="white">It's a good restaurant, Dhruv.</font>

87
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,765
<font color="white">I know people there.</font>
  
  <font color="white">We'll get a reservation also.</font>

88
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:10,165
<font color="white">Let's try that new pizza place in Bandra.</font>

89
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:13,245
<font color="white">-Pizza? He's going to eat pizza?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-German street food place!</font>

90
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:15,845
<font color="white">-It's okay. It's not that good.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Actually, you know what?</font>

91
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:18,485
<font color="white">-Let's go to a nice salad place.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Sister-in-law,</font>

92
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:22,125
<font color="white">-I can't eat salads.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Salad.</font>

93
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,725
<font color="white">Why are you laughing?</font>
  
  <font color="white">When are you leaving?</font>

94
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:27,365
<font color="white">Make him understand.</font>
  
  <font color="white">He's skipping work again.</font>

95
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:30,525
<font color="white">-Skipping?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-He's like a house husband.</font>

96
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,565
<font color="white">I'm not skipping. I'll work from here.</font>

97
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:34,645
<font color="white">It's very boring in the office.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I'm not going.</font>

98
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:36,965
<font color="white">By the way,</font>
  
  <font color="white">when did you get so excited about food?</font>

99
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:40,125
<font color="white">You eat the same thing everywhere:</font>
  
  <font color="white">pizza, pasta or Thai.</font>

100
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,205
<font color="white">I'm being experimental with my food.</font>
  
  <font color="white">Let me be!</font>

101
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:45,245
<font color="white">Don't do it today. Let's eat</font>
  
  <font color="white">mutton cutlet gravy with bread. Simple.</font>

102
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:47,965
<font color="white">Dhruv, he's from Delhi.</font>
  
  <font color="white">He must have eaten better--</font>

103
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:49,885
<font color="white">Even I'm from there.</font>
  
  <font color="white">But trust me when I say it.</font>

104
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:53,365
<font color="white">-This is special. I'm telling the truth.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Okay, do what you want or ask him.</font>

105
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,925
<font color="white">Bro, what do you want to eat?</font>

106
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,965
<font color="white">Mutton cutlet gravy with bread,</font>

107
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,085
<font color="white">or some posh Italian or Mexican</font>
  
  <font color="white">from some random place?</font>

108
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:03,165
<font color="white">-Dhruv!</font>
  
  <font color="white">-It's simple.</font>

109
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:07,045
<font color="white">-Let's go where the hot girls are.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-That's it. Finished. This was easy.</font>

110
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,445
<font color="white">-You are going where I'm taking you.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-You are a fucker.</font>

111
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,765
<font color="white">Why? Everyone has their preference.</font>

112
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:14,405
<font color="white">If I come to Bombay,</font>
  
  <font color="white">I'll check out the scene, right?</font>

113
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:15,845
<font color="white">Fair enough.</font>

114
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,965
<font color="white">You've been struggling with your shoes</font>
  
  <font color="white">for two hours. Wear mine.</font>

115
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,765
<font color="white">No, dude. I bought these</font>
  
  <font color="white">especially for this event.</font>

116
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,845
<font color="white">It's a very big event. People are coming</font>
  
  <font color="white">from Spain, Italy, China, even Tunisia.</font>

117
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:26,805
<font color="white">Even from Tunisia.</font>

118
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:30,165
<font color="white">-What is the event?</font>

  <font color="white">in a stripper club.</font>

123
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:46,805
<font color="white">You remember what we said as kids?</font>
  
  <font color="white">I'm going to be a professional footballer.</font>

124
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:49,765
<font color="white">I'll be a car racer, a fighter pilot--</font>

125
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:52,645
<font color="white">You guys are getting late. Listen to me.</font>

126
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,765
<font color="white">Take the train, you'll get there sooner.</font>

127
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,405
<font color="white">-The train is for the poor, right?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-What?</font>

128
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:01,085
<font color="white">-Yes.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Don't say stuff like that.</font>

129
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,845
<font color="white">You can say it with us,</font>
  
  <font color="white">but don't say it outside.</font>

130
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,365
<font color="white">-Why? Do you remember Simran?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Come on, guys.</font>

131
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:08,845
<font color="white">Stinky Simran.</font>

132
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,485
<font color="white">-Dhruv, dude, what the fuck!</font>
  
  <font color="white">-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

<font color="white">It's not that bad. I'll clean everything.</font>

134
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:15,205
<font color="white">You know what happened?</font>

135
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:18,045
<font color="white">-Listen we need to hurry up.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Sister-in-law, one sec.</font>

136
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,325
<font color="white">-Sit down.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Sit and listen. Just this once.</font>

137
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,125
<font color="white">-It's cool.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-We were going to</font>

138
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:24,285
<font color="white">Udaipur, it was Udaipur, right?</font>
  
  <font color="white">For a school trip.</font>

139
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,365
<font color="white">Someone locked our classmate Simran</font>
  
  <font color="white">in the train's toilet.</font>

140
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:30,365
<font color="white">The whole night.</font>
  
  <font color="white">The whole night in the train's toilet.</font>

141
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:32,565
<font color="white">That's horrible. Who did that?</font>

142
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:35,245
<font color="white">We don't know. But we thought it would be</font>
  
  <font color="white">our Hindi teacher.</font>

143
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:37,445
<font color="white">Because he complained about</font>
  
  <font color="white">the Hindi teacher.</font>

144
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,245
<font color="white">-Yes.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-The whole night?</font>

145
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,925
<font color="white">-The whole night. Locked.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-He stank so badly.</font>

146
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:45,045
<font color="white">And he's been called</font>
  
  <font color="white">Stinky Simran since then.</font>

147
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:48,045
<font color="white">-Simran was a boy?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Yeah.</font>

148
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,365
<font color="white">He was Sikh. Simran Singh.</font>

149
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,565
<font color="white">-His mother's name.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-You tell it.</font>

150
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:56,285
<font color="white">-Gurmeet. His dad's name.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Dimple Singh.</font>

151
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:59,965

  <font color="white">-It could have been Dimple Kapadia.</font>

152
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,765
<font color="white">This lift is so bloody slow, dude.</font>

153
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:14,965
<font color="white">-What happened?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Nothing.</font>

154
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:18,885
<font color="white">No one sat with Simran</font>
  
  <font color="white">on that trip, right?</font>

155
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:20,845
<font color="white">Stinky Simran.</font>

156
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,485
<font color="white">I think he was alone</font>
  
  <font color="white">in all his photographs from the trip.</font>

157
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,085
<font color="white">We were so bad, dude, right?</font>

158
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,285
<font color="white">I swear.</font>

159
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,325
<font color="white">-Bye, baby, have a nice day.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Bye.</font>

160
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:40,525
<font color="white">-Okay, Bindu, bye-bye.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Good luck.</font>

161
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:44,285
<font color="white">-And...</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Go on, leave.</font>

162
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,205
<font color="white">No, everyone talks about it.</font>
  
  <font color="white">But nothing happens.</font>

163
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:58,165
<font color="white">Bro, what's the scene?</font>
  
  <font color="white">What are you looking at? I'm sitting here.</font>

164
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:01,245
<font color="white">Talk to me.</font>
  
  <font color="white">Give her attention later. Okay?</font>

165
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,685
<font color="white">My ears are with you, bro, right?</font>

166
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,845
<font color="white">Anyway, you know nothing will happen.</font>
  
  <font color="white">And no one cares.</font>

167
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:09,925
<font color="white">-Delhi Metro did the same thing.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-No.</font>

168
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:11,685
<font color="white">This is the misconception.</font>

169
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:15,325
<font color="white">I've researched this. Go to the Internet,</font>
  
  <font color="white">you'll find all the papers there.</font>

170
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,685
<font color="white">They didn't do anything.</font>

171
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:19,205
<font color="white">Tell me, is this chicken or beef?</font>

172
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:22,685
<font color="white">It's chicken.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I ordered it in front of you.</font>

173
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:26,285
<font color="white">What's wrong with beef?</font>
  
  <font color="white">It's pretty tasty.</font>

174
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:29,405
<font color="white">Since when have you started eating beef?</font>

175
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:32,285
<font color="white">As a kid, you fasted on Tuesdays.</font>

176
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,605
<font color="white">-Actually, man. You remember?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Yes.</font>

177
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,565
<font color="white">-And ate water chestnut during </font>

  <font color="white">Have you been here long?</font>

180
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,485
<font color="white">Yeah, obviously. Kavya, you are late</font>
  
  <font color="white">by 40 minutes, dude.</font>

<font color="white">He just blabbers. Everything is wonderful</font>
  
  <font color="white">now that you are here.</font>

185
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:59,005
<font color="white">-It's cool.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Don't serve me.</font>

186
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,605
<font color="white">-What? Why?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-I'm not hungry.</font>

187
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,405
<font color="white">We came here because of you.</font>

188
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:08,685
<font color="white">No, Dhruv, we're here for him.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I ate </font>

<font color="white">It's okay, nothing great.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I don't know why people rave about it.</font>

190
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:16,085
<font color="white">It's just bread</font>
  
  <font color="white">with fried potatoes inside.</font>

191
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,165
<font color="white">Yes. Sorry, dude.</font>
  
  <font color="white">It doesn't have a BMW in it.</font>

192
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:20,125
<font color="white">Would I eat a BMW?</font>

193
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,525
<font color="white">Okay, Delhi boys, what's been up?</font>

194
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,165
<font color="white">Nothing, sister-in-law</font>
  
  <font color="white">we were complaining about the Metro.</font>

195
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:27,525
<font color="white">We weren't complaining. We were talking.</font>

196
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,445
<font color="white">Discussion. Talk. Debate.</font>

  <font color="white">for the last four days.</font>

<font color="white">Even in my office, everyone is talking</font>
  
  <font color="white">about the Metro just because of him.</font>

199
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,885
<font color="white">Look, it's a good thing.</font>

200
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:39,965
<font color="white">They are planning to cut over 5,000 trees.</font>

201
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:43,325
<font color="white">What kind of a dumb fuck do you have to be</font>
  
  <font color="white">to not give a fuck about climate change?</font>

202
00:10:43,405 --> 00:10:45,165

<font color="white">No, we're having</font>
  
  <font color="white">cauliflower Manchurian here.</font>

<font color="white">-Fuck!</font>
  
  <font color="white">-What?</font>

  <font color="white">global warming is happening.</font>

210
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,565
<font color="white">What are these guys doing?</font>

211
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:06,925
<font color="white">-How can they be so loud?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Shall I tell you?</font>

212
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,685
<font color="white">They must be measuring.</font>

213
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:11,765
<font color="white">What?</font>

214
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,005
<font color="white">-Nothing. Old memories.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-You don't want to know.</font>

215
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:17,685
<font color="white">-But I'm asking!</font>
  
  <font color="white">-No, you're fine the way you are.</font>

216
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:19,685
<font color="white">Dhruv, tell me.</font>

217
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:23,485
<font color="white">Don't look like that.</font>
  
  <font color="white">You are not telling her.</font>

218
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,725
<font color="white">No! Don't tell her.</font>

219
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:28,805
<font color="white">Let's try it. She's cool. FTV.</font>

220
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,565
<font color="white">Since you asked for it. Basically,</font>

221

<font color="white">in the third standard all the boys</font>
  
  <font color="white">would go to the last bench</font>

  <font color="white">-Sorry.</font>

225
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:53,245
<font color="white">Why would you tell me this?</font>

226
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,085
<font color="white">My stomach is really feeling weird</font>
  
  <font color="white">right now.</font>

227
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,085
<font color="white">Shit, dude. Do you remember Keshav?</font>

228
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:07,405
<font color="white">Keshav died, dude.</font>

229
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:11,565
<font color="white">What?</font>

230
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:19,085
<font color="white">Kaku? Keshav? Our Keshav?</font>

231
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,925
<font color="white">-What do you mean he died? How?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-He died because of stomach cancer.</font>

232
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,125
<font color="white">Why are you telling me now?</font>

233
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:34,805
<font color="white">You will find out</font>
  
  <font color="white">if you get in touch with people.</font>

234
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,805
<font color="white">you have to really tell him.</font>

235
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:40,005
<font color="white">When he's in Delhi, he needs to</font>
  
  <font color="white">get in touch with his old school friends.</font>

236
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:42,085
<font color="white">People aren't going to chase you.</font>

237
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:43,765
<font color="white">I will.</font>

238
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:50,165
<font color="white">-He played football really well, right?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Yes.</font>

239
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,805
<font color="white">Sandeep, how was your conference?</font>

240
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:55,885
<font color="white">It was good.</font>

241
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,725
<font color="white">If you rent out your stuff...</font>

242
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,205
<font color="white">it feels second-hand. That's why.</font>

243
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:08,685
<font color="white">-Why?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Why?</font>

244
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:10,485
<font color="white">We live in a rented place, too.</font>

245
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,245
<font color="white">That's right. It's a different thing</font>
  
  <font color="white">when it comes to you.</font>

246
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:18,285
<font color="white">There's the film industry here. Okay?</font>

247
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,885
<font color="white">Shady things happen here.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I shouldn't say this, but...</font>

248
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:27,765
<font color="white">To sum it up, I don't want to</font>
  
  <font color="white">give my house to gays. That's it.</font>

249
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:32,045
<font color="white">How does it matter? What difference</font>
  
  <font color="white">does it make if they are lesbian or gay?</font>

250
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,485
<font color="white">You're right.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I don't mind if they are lesbians.</font>

251
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,285
<font color="white">They can take the house, dude.</font>

252
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:40,045
<font color="white">Bro, gays. Gays make me want to throw up.</font>

253
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,605
<font color="white">-What is this thing?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-What are you saying, dude?</font>

254
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,125
<font color="white">You're talking like this in 2018.</font>

255
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,805
<font color="white">What's the problem with</font>
  
  <font color="white">talking like this in 2018?</font>

256
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:53,285
<font color="white">-How much is it?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Don't worry.</font>

257
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,765
<font color="white">-Are you mad?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Why are you paying?</font>

258
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:57,325
<font color="white">-What are you doing?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Wait. I'll pay.</font>

259
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:58,925
<font color="white">-Listen, it's okay.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Where is my wallet?</font>

260
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,885
<font color="white">-Getting my wallet.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Are you mad?</font>

261
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:03,045
<font color="white">It's okay, Sandeep. It's done, Sandeep.</font>

262
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,165
<font color="white">-Finished. Have the cake.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-It's done.</font>

263
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:11,485
<font color="white">By God, you are a shameless man.</font>

264
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:13,325
<font color="white">What?</font>

265
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,645
<font color="white">Sister-in-law paid. You should have paid.</font>

266
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:19,405
<font color="white">I don't have money right now</font>
  
  <font color="white">so I didn't pay. What's the big deal?</font>

267
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:21,765
<font color="white">If you had asked me, I would have paid.</font>

268
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,685
<font color="white">Listen, it's really okay.</font>
  
  <font color="white">It's not a big deal.</font>

269
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:26,885
<font color="white">-It's not good.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-What's the problem? Just chill.</font>

270
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,965
<font color="white">The problem is, motherfucker,</font>

271
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,965
<font color="white">it's basic courtesy not to take money</font>
  
  <font color="white">from women.</font>

272
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:35,125
<font color="white">-Why are you acting like a fucker?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Please. Please don't say that.</font>

273
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,925
<font color="white">Which century are you living in, fucker?</font>
  
  <font color="white">Why are you talking like this?</font>

274
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:39,885
<font color="white">-Why are you talking like this?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Which century am I living in?</font>

275
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:42,165
<font color="white">And it's okay</font>
  
  <font color="white">that you are living so shamelessly?</font>

276
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:44,565
<font color="white">Shut the fuck up! What are you saying?</font>
  
  <font color="white">Talk decently.</font>

277
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,165
<font color="white">She is here, that's why</font>
  
  <font color="white">I'm not saying anything. Understood?</font>

278
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:52,605
<font color="white">What a weird, shameless man.</font>

279
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:53,765
<font color="white">Put it in a box.</font>

280
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,005
<font color="white">What time is Sandeep leaving?</font>

281
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:16,645
<font color="white">His flight is at 5:00.</font>
  
  <font color="white">He'll leave around 3:00.</font>

282
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,525
<font color="white">He went to his uncle's place, I think,</font>
  
  <font color="white">because he was upset.</font>

283
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:22,645
<font color="white">This wasn't his plan earlier.</font>

284
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:38,725
<font color="white">Dude, I don't think Sandeep and I</font>
  
  <font color="white">are really friends, you know?</font>

285
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,805
<font color="white">-Right?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-No, that's not true.</font>

286
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,485
<font color="white">You've just met after a really long time</font>
  
  <font color="white">and it happens.</font>

287
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,485
<font color="white">-He's a little different, you're a--</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Little?</font>

288
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,125
<font color="white">I mean, a lot.</font>

289
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:00,125
<font color="white">I mean, if we happened to meet</font>
  
  <font color="white">right now, as complete strangers,</font>

290
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:02,245
<font color="white">I'm sure we wouldn't become friends.</font>

291
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,205
<font color="white">Everything is different.</font>

292
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,045
<font color="white">He looks at the world so differently.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I look at the world differently.</font>

293
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,405
<font color="white">How can we be friends? And why</font>
  
  <font color="white">are we even trying to be friends?</font>

294
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,565
<font color="white">Kavya, what are you doing?</font>

295
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:18,205
<font color="white">I'm trying to have</font>
  
  <font color="white">a conversation here, no?</font>

296
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:20,445
<font color="white">Do it later. Come and sit for two minutes.</font>

297
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,365
<font color="white">Okay.</font>

298
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:24,845
<font color="white">Tell me.</font>

299
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,805
<font color="white">I don't know. I feel like we're pretending</font>
  
  <font color="white">to be friends. Why?</font>

300
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,525
<font color="white">Because we went to the same school</font>
  
  <font color="white">and lived in the same neighborhood?</font>

301
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,965
<font color="white">-That means something, Dhruv.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Means what?</font>

302
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:42,245
<font color="white">He's a part of your childhood.</font>
  
  <font color="white">He's a part of you.</font>

303
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,285
<font color="white">You can't just give up on friends</font>
  
  <font color="white">just because--</font>

304
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:45,765
<font color="white">Yeah, you can.</font>

305
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:48,245
<font color="white">Like, why is it important for me</font>

306
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,845
<font color="white">to be friends with 100 people</font>
  
  <font color="white">and not just 10 people?</font>

307
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:54,525
<font color="white">You can have 10 really good friends</font>
  
  <font color="white">and 100 friends in general.</font>

308
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:57,365
<font color="white">Imagine how fun it will be</font>
  
  <font color="white">to grow old together.</font>

309
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:00,285
<font color="white">You can tell your grandchildren</font>
  
  <font color="white">your stories.</font>

310
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:04,485
<font color="white">Like, we beat him a lot</font>
  
  <font color="white">in the third standard and all that.</font>

311
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:06,485
<font color="white">It'll be so nice.</font>

312
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:09,085
<font color="white">I don't know, man. It's just that...</font>

313
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:11,605
<font color="white">You have to figure this out.</font>

314
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:15,205
<font color="white">That what value is this person</font>
  
  <font color="white">adding to my present.</font>

315
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,285
<font color="white">Dhruv, is this the stock market?</font>

316
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,885
<font color="white">Stop looking at everything</font>
  
  <font color="white">like a math equation.</font>

317
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,685
<font color="white">I'm not looking at it mathematically.</font>
  
  <font color="white">It's a simple question.</font>

318
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,605
<font color="white">Why are he and I friends?</font>

319
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,045
<font color="white">You care about him, Dhruv,</font>
  
  <font color="white">and so does he. It's obvious, right?</font>

320
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:32,285
<font color="white">-I don't know.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-He got you sweets, right, Dhruv?</font>

321
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,485
<font color="white">That's just Delhi manners</font>
  
  <font color="white">or manners in general.</font>

322
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:36,765
<font color="white">Doesn't mean anything.</font>

323
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,765
<font color="white">-Where is the sweets vendor?</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Near the school.</font>

324
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,165
<font color="white">He went all the way there</font>
  
  <font color="white">to get you sweets?</font>

325
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:43,605
<font color="white">The shop is just ten minutes away.</font>

326
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:45,685
<font color="white">Dhruv, stop being so negative, dude.</font>

327
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:49,365
<font color="white">He got you your favorite sweets</font>
  
  <font color="white">from your favorite sweets vendor.</font>

328
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,645
<font color="white">It's not just manners.</font>
  
  <font color="white">There is a thought behind it.</font>

329
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:57,645
<font color="white">If you can laugh at same jokes, you can</font>
  
  <font color="white">definitely have lot of fun together.</font>

330
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:00,085
<font color="white">That's the starting point, right?</font>

331
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:04,805
<font color="white">And this is bound to happen. You are not</font>
  
  <font color="white">going to agree on a lot of things.</font>

332
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,765
<font color="white">-It's part of growing up.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Yeah, but,</font>

333
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,285
<font color="white">should I tell him?</font>

334
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:12,085
<font color="white">That your point of view</font>
  
  <font color="white">about certain things is absolutely shit.</font>

335
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:13,605
<font color="white">Of course you should.</font>

336
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:16,565
<font color="white">But you have to promise</font>
  
  <font color="white">to keep in touch with him.</font>

337
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:20,405
<font color="white">You can't treat this as a one-off argument</font>
  
  <font color="white">with someone.</font>

338
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,765
<font color="white">But you don't want to make the effort.</font>

339
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:28,685
<font color="white">Why am I going crazy about this?</font>
  
  <font color="white">I didn't even get the mutton cutlet.</font>

340
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:32,445
<font color="white">You are just overthinking.</font>
  
  <font color="white">I want those sweets now.</font>

341
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:34,965
<font color="white">I'm going to get it. Give me two minutes.</font>

342
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:47,085
<font color="white">You know when I was in the 12th grade</font>
  
  <font color="white">after our basketball game,</font>

343
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,405
<font color="white">our PT teacher, Indrani Ma'am,</font>

344
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:51,125
<font color="white">she'd taken us all out</font>

345
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:54,805
<font color="white">to eat ice cream sundae at this</font>
  
  <font color="white">new place called Bharat Jalpan</font>

346
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,805
<font color="white">-that had opened in Nagpur.</font>
  
  <font color="white">-Bharat Jalpan.</font>

347
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:01,845
<font color="white">Yeah. And she said something to us</font>
  
  <font color="white">back then which has still stayed with me.</font>

348
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:04,845
<font color="white">She said after school,</font>

349
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:10,365
<font color="white">you're going to face a lot of times</font>
  
  <font color="white">when you'll be confused and lost.</font>

350
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:14,925
<font color="white">But during those times you should</font>
  
  <font color="white">come home and talk to your old friends.</font>

351
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,925
<font color="white">Because while everything around you</font>
  
  <font color="white">is changing,</font>

352
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:23,285
<font color="white">you will be happy to know that there</font>
  
  <font color="white">are a few things that remain constant.</font>
