1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,040
"And the next thing he saw was this bare
hand of his going right into the middle

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,080
of a great glistening mass of black,

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,480
and he gave one piercing cry
as it touched.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,160
Outside in the sunshine,
far away behind the house,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,440
the mother was looking for her son."
So good, no?

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,120
I didn't really get the end, though.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,680
Maybe it means

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,080
how we all grow up
and our parents don't really get that.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
And we are busy on our own adventures,

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
but our parents
are looking for their child.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,960
It must be something like that, I think.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,320
That does sound nice, no?

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,440
-Fuck, now I feel like calling my mom.
-I know, right.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,640
All right, bro.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
-Did you just say "eyebrow"?
-No.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,000
I said...

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,000
all right, bro.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,880
-All right, bro.
-Okay.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm gonna set an alarm for tomorrow.
I have a long day.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Set it for when you have to wake up
and not an hour before that.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,520
I need an hour to wake up.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,160
Yeah, but it disrupts my sleep.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Fine.

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,040
I'll set an alarm for 30 minutes
before I need to wake up.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,320
No, 40.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,200
Forty-five. Please.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
Good night.

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,200
I love you.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,880
Good night. I love you, too.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,400
Fuck, dude.

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
It's happening again?

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,240
What breed of mosquitoes are these, man?
They're completely immune to repellents.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
You got one?

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,720
I also killed one.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,240
That's amazing.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,240
Two down, 200 to go.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,080
Momo, let's cover our heads and sleep.
I have work tomorrow.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,160
Fuck this.

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,400
Kavya, get up, man.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Do something, man.

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,880
Get up!

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,520
Okay,
you're not gonna let me sleep either.

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm going to find a solution for this
once and for all.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
380 rupees, madam.

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,320
How can it be 380 rupees?
It's just mosquito oil and ice cream.

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Thank you.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
What is this?

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,800
Why does it say fire and ice?

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,960
I know, right?

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,000
Why would anyone want to use this?

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
Especially in Bombay
where it's already so hot and humid.

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,640
We'll find out.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,360
-We aren't using this, Dhruv.
-Why not?

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,320
Because why would I want
to feel hot or cold down there?

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
I don't know. We'll find out.
What's the worst that can happen?

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll go to the doctor, say,

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,600
"I was having sex
wearing a Fire & Ice condom

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,880
-and my pubes caught fire."
-Hey, let's go.

59
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Good night, bro.

60
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,600
Stop walking so fast.

61
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm not walking fast.
You are walking slowly.

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,720
-Mine is better.
-Let me try.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
Sure.

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,760
Want anything else?
A back massage or something?

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,720
-What the fuck was that?
-What the hell was that?

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,840
Somebody just smacked the back of my head!
I will screw your happiness, asshole!

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Mr. Delhi 2016. Relax.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
The fuck?

69
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
-Who is he?
-Shit. He is taking a U-turn.

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Fuck this, let's run, let's run.

71
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,760
Shit-face!

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Where are you running off to?

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,240
Karan,
what the fuck are you doing here, man?

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,600
-How are you?
-How are you doing?

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,840
-Been ages, dude. How have you been?
-All good, dude. All good.

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
You tell me.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,640
Nothing, man.
Just here for, like, four hours.

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,840
Came here for a day for work.

79
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,040
You tell me, how are you?
Running private tuitions like Mishra?

80
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
I'm seriously thinking of doing it.

81
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,400
By the way, that's Kavya.

82
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,440
Kavya, he's Karan.

83
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,280
This guy shat his shorts in second grade.

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,560
-Good to know.
-Thanks, man.

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,960
That's the best introduction
anyone's ever given for me.

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,160
But this is my assholic friend, Dhruv.

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,840
Who was caught by a teacher
in fifth grade,

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,840
stealing a second grade kid's lunch
and eating it.

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,840
-That's horrible.
-Stuffing his face.

90
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,320
Basically you used to steal
other people's food since you were a kid.

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,360
See, I was always this cute.

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
No. You were always this fat, you needed
that much food to stuff in your face.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,760
His food used to be very delicious.
Tell her, dude.

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,680
It's justified.

95
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,160
-You would have done the same thing.
-I wouldn't.

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,200
No one would have done that. You look
better in real life than your pictures.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,880
-Thanks.
-If you don't mind me asking,

98
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
what are you doing with this loser?

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,360
I don't know. Chilling? Time pass.

100
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,760
-Yeah, time pass.
-Really?

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,080
Time pass?

102
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,120
Have you ever seen your face? Dhanush.

103
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
-What?
-Dude, wait.

104
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,320
You are exactly like that,
like Dhanush and Sonam Kapoor.

105
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,920
Come on, your auto is waiting.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,360
I like this, I'm going to use this.

107
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,400
Except he makes Dhanush
look like a supermodel.

108
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,560
Fuck off.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,080
-That's a good one.
-You can use that next time on him.

110
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,480
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

111
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,080
-What are old friends for?
-I'm gonna head out. This was great.

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Come home.

113
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,360
Yeah, true.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,640
Let's grab a beer.

115
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,640
Next time. Next time, I promise. Okay?

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,280
Because I just had the midnight buffet
and drinks at the Marriott.

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,720
Marriott? Big man.
You're running private tuitions, too?

118
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
I got a really good deal on Little App.

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,200
-Sweet. I love that shit.
-Yeah, like fancy times.

120
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,920
Technology changing our lives. It's great.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
-True.
-Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go.

122
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,680
-I will see you guys later.
-Have fun.

123
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,280
It was a pleasure meeting you.

124
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,760
-See you, bye.
-See you, bro.

125
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,440
The next time you're here let me know,
we'll do something together.

126
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,080
I will. Definitely. See you.
Bye. Good night.

127
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,320
Do all the guys from Delhi sound the same?

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,600
-Why is my phone vibrating so much?
-You're also awaiting Tinder action.

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm sorry. Do you know
where a pharmacy that has condoms is?

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Go straight and make a right.

131
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,160
24-hour medical shop.

132
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
-It's gonna be open, definitely?
-Yeah.

133
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Okay.

134
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,240
-Use it. It's our favorite. We love it.
-Dude.

135
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
-You're super cool.
-I know, right?

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,360
You're much cooler than--
Look at your face.

137
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,680
You're so much cooler than him.

138
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Okay, if you decide to leave him,
definitely, you should give me a call.

139
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,760
I have his number.

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
-I'm gonna see you guys. Good night.
-Bye.

141
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
-Bye. I'm getting late.
-See you, bro.

142
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,320
And laid. So, it's a great night for me.
See you.

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,520
Have fun.

144
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,760
-So proud of yourself, no?
-Very.

145
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,520
Kavu, come out and talk!

146
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,960
Kavya, come out and talk.
I can't hear anything.

147
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
Why are you ignoring me?

148
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm not ignoring you, dude.
I couldn't hear anything.

149
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,080
Sandwich?

150
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,080
How can you be hungry again?

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,640
First of all, we had such a heavy dinner,
ice cream also.

152
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,320
But that ice cream fell.

153
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,680
So, that craving is still there.
Yes or no?

154
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
Yeah, okay. Make one for me.

155
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,840
Listen.

156
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,200
Vivek's getting engaged.

157
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,120
Vivek?

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,840
Oh, Vivek.

159
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,160
Your first boyfriend from Nagpur.

160
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,760
Isn't he the same guy who put
a photo collage of you and his mother?

161
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,600
Captioned it as what? "Lovers."

162
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,560
That was fifth grade, Dhruv.

163
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,720
Will you stop remembering
weird things about my exes.

164
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
-But it's just funny, dude.
-I'm being serious.

165
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,640
Serious. Wait.
Yeah, we should take this seriously.

166
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,200
Salami. We should put that salami.
You want that salami?

167
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
-Yeah, whatever. Okay, put.
-Yes.

168
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,480
It's weird to know
that he's getting engaged.

169
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,240
He was my first boyfriend
and the longest one.

170
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,280
So nice. Did you just say that?

171
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,080
I meant that was the longest relationship
I was a part of.

172
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Sure, right?

173
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,400
Stop being cheap.

174
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
What cheap? You said it.

175
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm just repeating it.

176
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,400
You won't feel weird
if your ex gets married?

177
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,680
You know, it depends.
If the pretty one gets married, then, yes.

178
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,280
If the other "blah" one gets married.
I'll be like,

179
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,520
"Whatever, they got married."

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,520
-So Delhi.
-What's so Delhi about this?

181
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,840
If that guy,
the same Nagpur guy part two--

182
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,880
And who used to call you what? "Jaanu."

183
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,880
If that guy gets married,
are you really going to be upset?

184
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,920
Be honest.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,840
First of all,
he was my high school boyfriend.

186
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,200
Will you stop remembering weird things
about my exes and making me feel guilty?

187
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.
All I'm saying,

188
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
it's good to remember the fun things
about exes and forget the bad shit.

189
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Otherwise, how else will you date again?

190
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,120
<i>No! No, you fucking don't! Who is this?</i>

191
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,040
You see that?

192
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,120
<i>-Who the fuck is this?</i>
-Are you still thinking about him?

193
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
Yeah. I'm sorry.

194
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
I saw that girl's profile sometime back.

195
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,560
And she's pretty, dude.

196
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
Now I'm feeling even more terrible.

197
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,480
Okay.

198
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,080
Simple maths.

199
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,960
No, no, no. Listen.
This is going to make sense.

200
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Ninety-seven percent of Indian males

201
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,840
that get married are between
the age group of 18 to 35.

202
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,560
That means, if you have 100 friends,

203
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,520
52 will be boys, 48 will be girls
according to the sex ratio.

204
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,560
Out of those 52,
you must have dated at least three boys.

205
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Just say yes. Don't act innocent.

206
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah?

207
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,200
So, the chances of your ex
not getting married is...

208
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,160
0.03 percent. This much.

209
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,160
-Makes no difference.
-What's your point?

210
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,000
The point is that him getting married
is actually the normal thing.

211
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,160
What you should do is send him a message.

212
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
"Congratulations.

213
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,360
Please don't make another photo collage
of your wife and your mother

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,960
and put it on Facebook as your DP.
Because that shit is not cool, man."

215
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,480
And he is capable of doing that.
You know that.

216
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,720
Sent him a message. You'll feel good.

217
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,200
Even if you don't, give it two days.
You'll forget about all of this.

218
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,880
We are too busy
to remember any of this for too long.

219
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
What an amazing speech, Dhanush!

220
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,400
No. What has Karan taught you, man.

221
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,920
It's going to be your new thing, no?

222
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
Yeah, I guess you're right.

223
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,160
He's a nice guy
and I suppose I am happy for him.

224
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,240
How nice.
Now can we just finish this topic?

225
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,000
Mosquitoes are dead but we're
talking about the same thing.

226
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,120
This is so nice.

227
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,080
I know, man. I know.

228
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,880
What?

229
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,800
Bite?

230
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,800
No.

231
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,840
Okay, small bite.

232
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,000
Why would you do that?

233
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,080
-Do what?
-That's the best part of a sandwich.

234
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,480
Why would you do that? That's horrible.

235
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,560
See, these are the things
that you should feel bad about.

236
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,880
Not your ex getting married.
That shit doesn't even matter.

237
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,720
-Yeah, yeah, I get the point.
-Yeah?

238
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,880
But I'm more hungry.

239
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,760
Will you make one and split?

240
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,640
Now we're talking.
Just give me two minutes.

241
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,880
-Now we'll get a good night's sleep, too.
-What's the connection?

242
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,120
The more you eat, the better you sleep.

243
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,160
Even pandas do this, don't they?

244
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,840
Pandas don't have to get up
in the morning for office.

245
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
Pandas are damn lucky, dude,
come to think of it.

246
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,200
I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

247
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,520
-What's the time?
-At 3:30 a.m.

248
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,480
It's 3:30?

249
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,120
Okay, let's just finish this episode
and sleep, man.

250
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,400
<i>You didn't have to bring up</i>
<i>my ethnicity or my size.</i>
