1
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:11,445
<i>My God.</i>

2
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:20,605
Are you okay?

3
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:25,325
Shit. I'm sorry.

4
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,125
I didn't mean to wake you up.

5
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:31,405
-No, it's fine.
-Must be some allergy.

6
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,045
Come here. Good morning.

7
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,645
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

8
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:41,885
You gave me a bath for no reason.
You know I don't shower on Sundays.

9
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,765
-Gross.
-Sorry.

10
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,765
It was a sneeze. It happens.

11
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,125
Come here.

12
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,245
Kavu? You have fever.

13
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:04,845
I don't feel so good.

14
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,605
-So lie down, it's Sunday. Take rest.
-I'll sweat it out.

15
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:09,965
What? Sweat it out?

16
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:13,525
Why are you being so hardcore?
Come and lie down.

17
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,165
-I have plans.
-What plans?

18
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:17,645
I have to go for a run,

19
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:20,885
then I have to go to
the smoothie-making workshop.

20
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,845
Then I have to go to the parlor.

21
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,365
And then I have to go to the flea market.

22
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:26,725
I'll make the smoothie.

23
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:29,725
-Why do you have to go to the parlor?
-Manicure, pedicure.

24
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:31,805
Wait.

25
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:44,245
Here you go. Book it.

26
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,645
-I'm sick.
-So?

27
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:50,285
You can still try and feel good
when you're sick. Book it. My treat.

28
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:54,005
Experience everything.

29
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,045
Experience everything.

30
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:00,365
Doesn't it sound like a Dubai tourism ad?
Experience everything.

31
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,045
Shall I sell the idea?
I'll make a lot of money.

32
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,445
This is so fuck-all, dude.

33
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,445
I get just one Sunday
and I had to get sick.

34
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:11,565
It's okay. You lie down. Get some rest.

35
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:14,685
-Take a Crocin and you will be fine.
-Are you my mother?

36
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,405
Crocin for everything.

37
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:18,605
Take a Crocin for this.
Take a Crocin for that.

38
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,365
-Whatever happens, take a Crocin.
-What else should I give you?

39
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:24,285
You have fever. You'll be fine.
Just take a Crocin.

40
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,485
I'm just irritated. You come fast.

41
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:34,605
-What is it?
-Moonlight.

42
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,605
-Really, Dhruv?
-Yes, really.

43
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,125
You are the one who wants so many things.
I just want one thing.

44
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,125
My mutton cutlet gravy.
I don't even get that.

45
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:45,165
I keep chanting Moonlight, Moonlight,
Moonlight like a fool.

46
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,645
-Fuck you, man.
-No, fuck you, dude.

47
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:49,325
Your face is a fuck-you.

48
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:52,845
Lie down comfortably.

49
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:30,885
Apart from manicure and pedicure,
what other services do you offer?

50
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:35,645
Ma'am, we offer facials, hair,
all salon services.

51
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,165
Wow. See?

52
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:43,045
This is luxury. A luxurious  life.

53
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:44,965
Seriously, Kulkarni.

54
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:48,005
-See!
-Very pretty.

55
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:54,005
-Ma'am, sure you won't have anything?
-No, sir, thank you.

56
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:56,165
-Just let me know.
-Yes, sir, thank you.

57
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:00,365
Here. Bon appetite.

58
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:04,165
-It looks very beautiful.
-Doesn't it?

59
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:06,685
-This flower.
-That's what I meant.

60
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,765
Hibiscus. It bloomed today.

61
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:12,805
I thought since your food wasn't
looking good, I'd make it look good.

62
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,005
How can you eat that?

63
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:17,765
With my mouth.

64
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,085
Why are you frowning?

65
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:22,925
It's Sunday. Cheat day. Let's enjoy it.

66
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,325
What are the rest of the days
for you, Dhruv?

67
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:27,285
I love you, dude.

68
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:28,645
Fuck you.

69
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:33,085
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to the sandwich.

70
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,205
Why you being mean to me?

71
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:38,605
Ma'am, this is done.
Would you like anything else done?

72
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,565
It's your treat, right, Dhruv?
What else should I get done?

73
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:45,885
Well played.

74
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,725
-Here, take a bit. Trophy. Hello?
-Thanks.

75
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,565
It doesn't make a difference.

76
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:05,405
Don't do that.

77
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:10,245
Don't do that, dude! Why are you
doing that? Annoying me needlessly.

78
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,005
It's fun.

79
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,965
Shall we watch <i>Silver Linings?</i>

80
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,925
No, I've watched it many times.
Won't watch it again.

81
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:19,005
So what's on the list?
You're checking a girl out?

82
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,685
-No. I mean yes.
-How shameless.

83
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,725
-She's just a girl.
-I've seen it. No need to hide

84
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,085
She was in my course in college, okay?

85
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:26,325
-In your course?
-Yes.

86
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:28,405
I thought your math course
didn't have pretty girls.

87
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:31,125
She left to somewhere else
after two weeks.

88
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,205
So I was checking to see where she went.

89
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,885
-Where did she go?
-So much concern.

90
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:40,205
She must have gotten confused between
psychology and math. Poor thing.

91
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:44,005
She popped up in suggested friends.
Genuinely came up in suggested friends.

92
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:46,885
It's Facebook's fault, not mine.
Mark is a bastard.

93
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,245
You couldn't say that before?

94
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:51,085
Okay, well. Mark is a bastard.

95
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,205
No, dude! Why do you keep sneezing
in my face?

96
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:55,405
Why not there?
Want to make me sick?

97
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,725
Shut up and look at the list.

98
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,605
-Let's watch films.
-Now you wait and watch. 90s special.

99
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:06,445
<i>-Coolie No.1. Hero No.1.</i>
-Dude. No.

100
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,045
<i>-Dulhe Raja. </i>What?
-Dhruv?

101
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:11,245
I'm not in the mood for these films.

102
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:14,325
Yeah, but there were actually good films.
Now everyone pretends to be cool.

103
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,205
Tell me.

104
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:23,445
<i>Terminator 1?</i>

105
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,965
-God bless you. <i>Terminator 2?</i>
-Sorry.

106
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,125
-Don't want to watch that.
<i>-Terminator 3?</i>

107
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,365
Dhruv, be creative, dude.

108
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,645
What do you mean by that?
I don't remember what happened.

109
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:39,045
-What happened?
-It doesn't matter.

110
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,125
I want to watch a different film.

111
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:51,485
<i>-Monsters Inc.?</i>
-Dhruv, you know what?

112
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,405
I'm really tired, okay?

113
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:57,885
We've spent more time in deciding what to
watch instead of actually watching it.

114
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,245
<i>-Jajantaram Mamantara.</i>
<i>-</i>Dhruv!

115
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:04,085
Okay. Wait. So what do you want to do?

116
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,405
-Start/Stop?
-Okay, go!

117
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:09,045
Okay. Start!

118
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:11,005
-Stop!
-"K."

119
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:14,805
"K." All right, come on, "K."

120
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,165
-"K."
-"K, k, k..."

121
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:21,005
The first film is <i>Kama Sutra,</i> Dhruv.

122
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:22,125
Should we see it?

123
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:26,045
-Actually, I've seen it, dude.
-Really?

124
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:29,125
-Yeah, I mean, I've seen all the scenes.
-Obviously.

125
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:31,805
We used to skip tuition,
go to the cybercafe and do this.

126
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,885
What an education, man. Sex education.

127
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:35,845
-Let's watch it.
-Yes!

128
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,085
Today I'll find out what the story was.

129
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:40,965
Actually, you know what? You watch it.

130
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,965
-I'll just finish some work.
-Turn that way.

131
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:46,485
There will be no more sneezes.

132
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,605
Night cycling in Bombay
sounds like a nice plan, no?

133
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:12,885
Can you please get excited
about at least one plan?

134
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:15,245
Yes, dude, it sounds all right.

135
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,405
Cycle on.

136
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,885
This stew is really nice. Thank you.

137
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,005
Thank you.

138
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:33,005
Every time I fall sick,
I feel like eating <i>khichdi.</i>

139
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,125
Mom has made it a habit.

140
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,405
You know the worst part
about falling sick?

141
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,645
Nothing tastes good.

142
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:51,325
But I hope I feel better by tomorrow.

143
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,325
If someone coughs in the office,
even accidentally,

144
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,885
everyone stares at that person
like they're a criminal.

145
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,485
Dhruv, I'm talking to you, no?

146
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:07,805
Tell me something.

147
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:12,165
Why does pizza
always taste better the next day?

148
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,565
-Because you enjoy it more.
-Yes. But why?

149
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:20,605
Only two or three slices are left.
You fully enjoy it.

150
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,485
No, but mutton also tastes better.

151
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,525
Beans also taste better the next day.
It's not that, it's something else.

152
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,405
There is something.

153
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,205
Shit, dude, I should have
photographed the stew.

154
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,805
Should have put that on Instagram.

155
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,085
My followers aren't increasing.
What do I do?

156
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:44,645
-Put my photo.
-No. Cheap tactics.

157
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,245
I prefer my food over your face.

158
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,885
On Instagram, silly. Not in life.

159
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:57,965
Are you mad? No, no, no!

160
00:09:58,485 --> 00:09:59,565
Infection.

161
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:04,365
Green tea. Dude, you need green tea.
You were coughing just now, right?

162
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:07,405
I'll get you green tea. Green tea. Yes!

163
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,885
At least you said something, you asshole.

164
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:21,685
It's evening.

165
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:30,445
The sound of the evening prayer on
a Sunday evening is depressing, no?

166
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:33,525
Why?

167
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:37,445
Because it reminds you
that the weekend is over.

168
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:40,645
But you love working.

169
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,325
But I love this more.

170
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:49,845
I love the evening prayer.

171
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:56,885
When I was a kid,
I used to come home from school,

172
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,845
I used to watch <i>Dexter</i> or <i>Scooby Doo.</i>

173
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,085
Then Vandana <i>didi </i>used to put me to sleep.

174
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,725
And when I heard the evening prayer,
I would wake up.

175
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:10,085
And then, exactly 15 minutes later,
Mom would come home from work.

176
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:14,285
So this sound reminds me of
my mom coming home. Always.

177
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:21,685
Have you fallen asleep?

178
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,525
No, dude.

179
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:29,285
It's so nice, no, how different people
relate to the same things differently?

180
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:43,845
Dhruv, I'm feeling better now.

181
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,365
I think I should take a shower.

182
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:51,765
-First get it fixed!
-I'll get it fixed tomorrow.

183
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:54,445
Fine. Then I will bathe tomorrow.

184
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,685
You are such a bad influence.

185
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,965
Don't tell your mother that.

186
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:13,365
How was it?

187
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:17,765
-What?
-The tea. Did you taste any difference?

188
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:22,005
-What did you do?
-I added fennel.

189
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,765
You didn't notice any difference?

190
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:26,485
I can't taste anything.

191
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,445
Good. I didn't give you my pizza.
It would have been pointless.

192
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:33,645
-See.
-What is this?

193
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,325
Mom is cleaning the cuboards.
So she found all this old stuff.

194
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,245
These are my drawings
from third grade.

195
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,365
Okay. But what is this?

196
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:44,205
This was my summer vacation project
that year.

197
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,605
The teacher had asked us to draw
the places that we wanted to visit.

198
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:51,765
And that year,
we were going to take a Euro trip.

199
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,965
The usual nine nights, ten days.

200
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,885
But then the company's manager quit,

201
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,205
and then Dad had to step in
so we didn't go.

202
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:01,725
What?

203
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:03,565
That sucks, man.

204
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,165
I know I was really sad,

205
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,045
and I didn't even know
what to do for this project.

206
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:10,085
So I drew these.

207
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:12,765
I really wanted to go to all these places.

208
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,965
You drew all this in the third grade?

209
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:21,725
-You must be good at geography.
-Much better than you.

210
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,725
-Why is everything a competition?
-It is.

211
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,005
-Come on then.
-Let's do it.

212
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:31,725
-You just like to lose.
-Sit straight.

213
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,365
-Ready?
-Yes. Begin.

214
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,445
-Name a country with "Z."
-Zimbabwe.

215
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,605
Name a city with "Q."

216
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:40,325
-Quito, the capital of Ecuador.
-Yes, of course.

217
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:43,165
-You didn't know that.
-I knew that. Shut up.

218
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:46,645
Name a mountain, river or lake
that starts with "K."

219
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,565
-Kilimanjaro. That was easy.
-Shit.

220
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,685
Name a city with "X."

221
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:51,925
With "X."

222
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,245
-Hurry up, you can't take so much time.
-Yes, one second.

223
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,645
Tick, tick, one. Tick, tick, two.

224
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:57,645
Xiaomi!

225
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:00,605
I asked for a city name,
not a phone company.

226
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:03,045
It is based there. Xiaomi is from Xiaomi.

227
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm telling the truth. I am not lying.

228
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:06,325
You tell me.

229
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:08,165
Xianning.

230
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:10,485
-Yes, Xianning!
-Yes, it is!

231
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:12,325
In China. Right next to Beijing.

232
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:13,965
-Look it up.
-Yes.

233
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:15,565
Xianning.

234
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:19,525
-I want to go to all these places.
-Where? Xianning and Xiaomi?

235
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:22,925
-Don't joke, I'm serious.
-It's not possible.

236
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,685
Why would you say that?

237
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,605
-It's such a horrible thing to say.
-Easy.

238
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:32,685
It's actually not possible, no?
How is it possible?

239
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,645
Just like I know that in this lifetime,

240
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,725
I can't buy a home at Marine Drive.

241
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,445
I can't become a professional footballer.

242
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:43,365
Why weep over what is not possible?

243
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:45,485
Enjoy what you have. Simple.

244
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,685
-I can't look at it that way.
-Why not? What's wrong with that?

245
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,485
I think if you dream about something,

246
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:52,245
and you work towards it,
you can achieve it.

247
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,485
It's not the way you think.

248
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:56,765
This is all from the <i>The Alchemist.</i>
It has messed up your mind.

249
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:00,165
But anyway, what works for you,
works for you.

250
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:02,285
What works for me, works for me.

251
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:04,165
You are crazy.

252
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:13,845
What is this, dude?

253
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,645
-What?
-This.

254
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,685
Why did you keep that on this?

255
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,645
-I'm sorry, I didn't realize it.
-Didn't realize it?

256
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,165
I didn't do it on purpose, Dhruv.

257
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:25,325
You could have kept it alive for one day.

258
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:29,285
Will you relax? It's a flower.

259
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,725
Let it be. You won't get it.

260
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:37,685
-You need to chill.
-I need to chill?

261
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,285
What is this, dude?

262
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:43,485
Okay, I'll be careful next time.

263
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,525
Anyway, you should work a bit.

264
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,805
Why are you so bothered suddenly?

265
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,925
No, you should work.
It will reduce your workload.

266
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:55,525
-Really?
-Yeah, work a little.

267
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:57,565
I thought you hate it
when I work on weekends.

268
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:58,485
No.

269
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,005
-Okay, work for 90 minutes.
-What is going on?

270
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,285
-Liverpool has a game.
-The match is about to start?

271
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,565
-Yes, yes.
-So just say that.

272
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:11,085
-Why are you playing games, Komolika?
-What? Komolika?

273
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,805
Where did she come from?
Fuck, what is she doing now?

274
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:16,965
-Komolika. Anyway, ta-ta, bye-bye.
-No, no!

275
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:20,165
You can watch it
but can you please watch it here?

276
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,365
No. Big screen, small screen.
Don't ruin it.

277
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,485
-Please? Please.
-No, dude.

278
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,325
-Fine.
-Okay.

279
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:34,565
Listen, you should draw more, you know.

280
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:37,165
I know.

281
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:39,965
You should doodle. You don't do anything.

282
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:42,765
I miss it, too. I will.

283
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:46,245
But not today. I'm sick, no?

284
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:49,765
Sloth bear is back.

285
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,565
Fuck! Fuck!

286
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,205
It was a last second goal, dude.
Last minute goal. Fuck!

287
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,245
What the fuck are you doing?

288
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:22,805
You were sleeping and I couldn't shout.
Sorry, but, I really wanted to scream

289
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,885
and I really wanted to say fuck you
to everyone.

290
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:27,925
Even to you. Fuck!

291
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:32,885
Who scored?
Was it a one-range goal by Salah

292
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:34,965
or Mané took a solo goal?

293
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,845
I go crazy
when you ask questions like that,

294
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,205
it makes me so happy.
Take all my money, dude.

295
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:41,725
You have money to give?

296
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:45,125
Shut up and understand feelings.
And it's not "Mai-ne" it's Mané.

297
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,565
Mané. Fuck! What a tap in by Firmino!

298
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:50,805
Last second, dude, last second.
It doesn't happen so quickly.

299
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,525
-Anything else?
-How crazy, dude!

300
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:00,245
Fuck!

301
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:02,805
I'll go get some water.

302
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:08,405
Crazy.

303
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:11,445
Why so many mosquitoes?

304
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,125
Is the All Out switched on?

305
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:19,165
You didn't put post the <i>khichdi </i>photos
on Instagram.

306
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:23,645
Actually I made two.
One for you and one for me.

307
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,725
Yours was bland and mine was spicy.

308
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,685
I don't know which one to post.

309
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,205
Are you crazy? Why are you laughing?

310
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,165
-Karma.
-Karma?

311
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:51,085
I don't want to get ill.
What does karma have to do with it?

312
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,045
Come, let me see.

313
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,885
-It's nothing.
-It's nothing, dude.

314
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:59,685
-It must be an allergy.
-Allergy to what?

315
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,445
Everything is the same.
We've been in the same room all day.

316
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,245
I don't know about you,
I'm feeling better now.

317
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,565
Yeah? Very good.

318
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:12,645
Listen, don't feel bad.

319
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:14,885
-What's up?
-I'm just being honest.

320
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:18,845
-You'r stinking.
-What?

321
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:21,725
I'm stinking?

322
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,365
I stink?

323
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,925
Kavya, do you know that
for the past few hours

324
00:19:27,045 --> 00:19:28,285
it's you who has been stinking?

325
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,005
You nose just cleared.
Smell yourself. Smell.

326
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,125
Like it?

327
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:36,965
Why didn't you tell me about it before?

328
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,725
I've been through far worse.
This is nothing.

329
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:42,565
-Stop talking about yourself.
-Buzz off.

330
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:47,925
Sleep here, there's place.

331
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:51,165
This is my spot. You threw me there
this afternoon, too.

332
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:53,845
I feel sleepy here,
this is where I will sleep. Move.

333
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:56,285
-Move, move.
-Stop being mean.

334
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,765
I hope the mosquitoes don't bite, dude.

335
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:10,365
Good nuts.

336
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:12,205
Good night.

337
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,685
Good night.
