1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,600
What do you think?

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,720
Don't take a picture.
I've not draped it properly.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,720
You look so beautiful.
When did you buy that nose thingy?

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
It's a nath, Dhruv.
It's a Maharashtrian design.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,000
Remember I told you
I was saving up for it?

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,880
I bought it a couple of weeks back
from VelvetCase.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,280
Something like that would make
anyone look pretty, no?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thanks, Dhruv. How charming.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,840
Anyway, I don't think it goes
with this sari.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,680
And this sari is also
not a very wedding-type.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,240
-I think I'm gonna try something new.
-Kavu. Please hurry up, man.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,960
We have to be up at 4 a.m. and leave.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,920
And that <i>bhajji</i> lady
sits only for three hours--

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,520
Just give me two minutes. I'll be back.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,360
What do you think of this?

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
It's nice.

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,080
See, I like this but somehow--

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Dhruv.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,240
It's nice.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, last one.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Dhruv.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,920
It's nice.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,080
Dhruv.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,800
It's nice.

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,200
Stop saying "it's nice" to everything.
Say something different.

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Hey, because it's just nice,
it's not amazing. It's too late.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,280
My mind is not working.

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,480
Kavu, let's go to bed. We have to get
up at 4 a.m. and travel for two hours.

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
I really want to eat those corn <i>bhajjis</i>.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,080
None of these are amazing,
and they're not going well with the nath.

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,400
I think I'll buy something nice
for Prachi's wedding.

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,960
-I'll come in two minutes. You sleep.
-Good night.

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,920
Good night.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,360
Wake up, Momo.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,720
-Wake up.
-Let me sleep two minutes.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
It's 12:30, Dhruv.

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,560
What?

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
Shit, we missed it.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,640
What the hell, man!

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,560
-You forgot to put the alarm?
-Because of the whole sari thing, no?

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, how is it my fault?
Don't turn this around me.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,600
You forgot to put the alarm.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah, because I was sleepy and confused.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
Yeah, it's okay!

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,800
No. I really wanted
to eat those <i>bhajjis,</i> man.

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,160
We've lost half a day.
Everyone else is having so much fun.

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,960
-We're sitting here in bed and--
-We were supposed to have a good time.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,400
But what is the point of us fighting now?
I know how to turn this Sunday around.

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,000
Give me 30 minutes,
and I'll fix something for you.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,440
Son of a bitch.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Kavu, we have to check
this new Kerala place out.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,840
It looks kick-ass.

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
Shit. It's not possible, no?

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
At least appreciate the effort, Dhruv.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,760
That I'll obviously do. But Bombay Bhukkad
put up this new post and I thought,

56
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,440
"let's eat something new today."

57
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,480
So, I couldn't help
but fantasize about food.

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,040
One minute! One minute!

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,160
Don't do that.

60
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,080
Bacon.

61
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,040
Wait, wait, wait.

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,480
What? Please let me eat.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm starving.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,440
Please.

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Get the mustard first, please.

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,440
Such an amazing experience, dude.

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,040
-What is?
-Dating a sloth bear like you.

68
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,800
-I'm not lazy, okay?
-Of course, no. Yeah. Sure.

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,840
-I'm just chilled out.
-Of course.

70
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,920
I made all this.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,040
I know, and it looks great.
I mean it. Thank you.

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,320
Dude, this Megha keeps traveling
all the time, man.

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,880
It's not fair. She even went
to a Coldplay concert. Look.

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,000
Show?

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Cool, man. Hey, how come we
don't have a Pokémon at home?

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,600
Viraj found two, you know?

77
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Not fair.

78
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay, listen. Let's watch a film.

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,760
Oh, it's my turn, no?

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,200
No. My turn.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,240
Shit, you remember.

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay.

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,240
Three, two, one.

84
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,160
<i>Inside Out.</i>

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,400
No! No, no, no.

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Hey, what's your problem?
I heard it's a good film.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,160
Yeah, it's a very good film.
But it's an animated film.

88
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,960
Those films have at least two,
three moments which will make you cry.

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,240
Then you'll get sentimental
and will stop talking.

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,120
Then I will keep asking,
"Kavu, what happened?"

91
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,680
"Do you want to talk?"
But you wouldn't want to talk.

92
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,240
But exactly at 7:00
you would want to talk,

93
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,600
and that's when Liverpool
will be playing Chelsea.

94
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,440
And then you'll make a face.
You make exactly this face.

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,560
Yes. This face. Hold, hold.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,320
So pretty when pissed off.

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,440
<i>Bing Bong.</i>

98
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,920
<i>You made it!</i>

99
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
-You okay?
-Yeah, obviously.

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,640
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,360
Oh, so cute. You cried and all.

102
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,760
This is why I didn't want
to watch this film.

103
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,680
Aakash is chilling in Goa
drinking beer at the beach.

104
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
And I'm sitting here mourning Bing Bong.

105
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,960
Don't ruin the film like that.
It's a good film.

106
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,320
I know, but I just wanted to watch
something nice, relaxed, funny.

107
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,600
Want to go to the arcade
and play air hockey?

108
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,320
Been a while
since I kicked your ass at it.

109
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
No way. Liverpool versus Chelsea, 7 p.m.

110
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,680
Hey, so what? One game.

111
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,680
Come on!

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Chicken.

113
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,640
-Okay, fine. One game. We'll be back by 7.
-Sure, you're on.

114
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,680
-You should not wear kohl on Sundays.
-Just like you don't shower on Sundays.

115
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,240
Exactly. At least once a week
we should know how we really look.

116
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,120
I think it's quite nice and intense.
It's very naked, no?

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
You talking to me?

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,080
<i>Taxi Driver,</i> like, so obvious.

119
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,080
Excuse me, sir.
If you don't mind me asking,

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,560
-where are you going?
-To play games.

121
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,080
-Arcade, Dhruv.
-Yeah, arcade.

122
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,120
-You can't go in.
-Why? What's the scene? Who are you?

123
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
Actually, I'm the manager
of this mall, sir.

124
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,200
There's a kid's birthday party upstairs.

125
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,600
And your T-shirt reads

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,440
"In Cock We Trust."

127
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,440
Yeah, so?

128
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,880
Sir, someone might file a complaint.
It could become an issue.

129
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
Please understand.

130
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,960
The T-shirt is referencing
my favorite chili sauce.

131
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,080
Sriracha is a name of a sauce, sir.

132
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200
That doesn't matter, ma'am.

133
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,600
If someone complains it will be a problem.
Plus, today is my first day.

134
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,960
Don't talk rubbish.
We want to play games, just let us in.

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
Try and understand, sir.

136
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,760
There could be a problem.
Someone could file a complaint.

137
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,760
-It would put my job at risk.
-How can you do this?

138
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,320
Please, please cooperate.

139
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,480
This is unacceptable!

140
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
Thank you so much, sir.
Thank you, thank you. Sorry.

141
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,600
Please come again tomorrow! Thank you!

142
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
How could he throw us out?

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
You should have taken a shower,
changed your T-shirt.

144
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,280
Today is a Sunday.
I don't bathe on Sundays.

145
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,920
-You know it.
-So, what do you wanna do now?

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,520
I don't know. Do you wanna
just go home and have sex?

147
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,120
At least don't look this bored
while saying it.

148
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,360
Then what should we do?

149
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,240
-Do you want to go to a salon with me?
-What? Why would I want to do that?

150
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,880
Because then I can get a hair spa,

151
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
and when you play with my hair,
it'll be more fun.

152
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,360
When was the last time I did that?

153
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,400
If I put my hand in there,
it'll get lost in there.

154
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,440
But you used to. And I miss all that.

155
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,040
-But I have a match.
-So, watch it on your phone.

156
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,120
Please.

157
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,600
I've decided. We're going to a salon,
and I'm buying a coupon on Little App.

158
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,600
We are not going.

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,840
-Don't buy coupons, you'll waste money.
-That won't happen.

160
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,800
I'll get a full refund.
That's not the point. It's Sunday.

161
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
-Just watch it on your phone.
-It's not the same thing!

162
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,800
Okay, see. There are 52 Sundays in a year,
amongst them, the chances of Liverpool--

163
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,920
I know, the chances of Liverpool
playing on a Sunday is 8.8 percent.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
-Yeah.
-But it's a Sunday. I wanna do something.

165
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,560
Pretty curls.
But why don't you maintain your curls?

166
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,720
-That would be nice.
-I don't know how to.

167
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,160
{\an8}Why don't you do any protein treatment

168
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,600
{\an8}or any kind of styling for your hair?

169
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,000
-Listen.
-Yeah?

170
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,800
Should I get the hair spa done
or a keratin treatment?

171
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,360
-If I get the keratin--
-Shit.

172
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,640
It was so close, man.

173
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,240
Yeah, get it done.

174
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Which one?

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,400
-Get the herbal one.
-Why not the extra protein one?

176
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
Get that. That's the best one.

177
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,600
You just watch your game.

178
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
You do what you think is best.

179
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,160
-Okay.
-Yeah? Yeah.

180
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,960
Fuck! Shit!

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,920
Costa! You son of a bitch!
Rascal! You swine! Dick! Son of a bitch!

182
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,240
-You need to talk to him.
-Yeah.

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,840
Could you please watch your match outside?

184
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,800
Sister fucker!

185
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
How's it looking?

186
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
What did you do?
I can't tell the difference.

187
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,160
Just like there's no difference
in Liverpool's position in the league?

188
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,680
Why are you getting angry?

189
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,800
You need to learn how to behave in public.

190
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,560
-It was a mistake, man.
-A mistake?

191
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,480
Really?

192
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,720
This was seriously by mistake.

193
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,640
Seriously.

194
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,040
Want to grab some dinner?

195
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,320
Chinese?

196
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,000
Mughlai?

197
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,800
It's too oily.

198
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,720
Italian?

199
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,720
Too boring.

200
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,640
Mexican?

201
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
Actually, I'm done.

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,360
Don't say that, man.

203
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,800
Hey, I'm full, but I'll have a little bit.
Promise.

204
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,080
Hey, let's go to that Kerala place.

205
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,800
Oh, yeah. How did I forget about that?

206
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,960
Good one, Kulkarni.

207
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,080
Always.

208
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
Forty-five minutes waiting.

209
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,640
Serious?

210
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
You know what? Let's go home.

211
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,320
Pick ingredients for Thai curry.
We'll have that with rice.

212
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,480
Best option.

213
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,720
Oh, yeah.

214
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,080
I can make a full Snap story
with instructions

215
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
on how to make Thai curry.
Screw you, Megha.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,360
Kavu, your day was nothing
like how you made it out on Snapchat.

217
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
Yeah, so what?

218
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,680
I don't wanna tell everyone
that I had a boring Sunday.

219
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,720
Everyone is going out to places and we're
sitting here doing what, I don't know.

220
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,680
What's this solid FOMO?

221
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,160
I know our day didn't go
according to the plan,

222
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,640
but it's not that we had
that bad a Sunday.

223
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
We had an epic breakfast.

224
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,720
Dude, I got chucked out of a salon.
Like, how often does that happen?

225
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,520
We'll be laughing about it for two months.

226
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,000
And seeing you
with those funny red hair clips,

227
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,000
and watching Coutinho score that goal,

228
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,840
now, that made my Sunday.

229
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,080
Of course, it could be much cooler
and much happening

230
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,960
but that can happen
on any other day, can't it?

231
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,160
And we still have to make that Thai curry!

232
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,920
Listen.

233
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,200
Can we just order pizza instead?
I am really tired.

234
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,960
Thank God you said that.
Even I'm very tired, man.

235
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,800
Wait, what about your Snap story, then?

236
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,720
I don't care.

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,200
-Yeah?
-Really.

238
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,440
-And what will people say?
-Other people can go to hell!

239
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,200
You know, it might sound lame,
but you know what I really want to do?

240
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,760
I want to have some pizza,

241
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,160
have a nice glass of red wine,
finish watching<i> Inside Out,</i>

242
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
and sleep.

243
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,800
That sounds perfect.

244
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,040
Sounds like our kind of Sunday.

245
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,960
Exactly.

246
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,960
{\an8}DHRUV: WHEN DID IT BECOME AVAILABLE?
